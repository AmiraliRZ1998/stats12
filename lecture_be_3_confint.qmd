# Sampling Theory Recap

## Sampling Theory - Population

* There exists a target population, consisting of all potential participants for our study
* These individuals posess a trait that could be measured as variable X
* If we had access to the entire population, we could calculate *population parameters*:
    + The mean population value of X, $\mu_x$
    + The population standard deviation of X, $\sigma_x$
    + Et cetera (population proportion of a binary variable, $\Pi_x$)
    
## Sampling Theory - Sample

* Sample: Select number of individuals from the population
    + Ideally, samples should be representative
    + Best way to ensure a representative sample is random sampling
* These individuals also posess trait X
* We can calculate their *sample statistics*:
    + The sample mean value of X, $M_x$ or $\bar{X}$
    + The sample standard deviation of X, $S_x$ or $SD_x$
    + Et cetera (sample proportion of a binary variable, $p_x$)

## Inference

Sample statistics are our best guesses about population parameters

* But they're never exactly correct
* The difference between the population parameter and the sample statistic is called the *sampling error*

We typically don't know the population parameter, so we don't know how big the sampling error is


1\. Test hypotheses about population values => dichotomous decision: the hypothesized value is rejected or not\.

2\. Estimation:  __point __ and  __interval estimates __ \(range of values\)

# Confidence interval

* A confidence interval is a “window of uncertainty” around our estimate
* How precise are our estimates?
* We can calculate confidence intervals for any estimate:
    * the sample mean
    * mean difference
    * regression coefficients
    * Correlations
    * \(other\) effect sizes such a Cohen’s  _d_
  * ……
* Today\, we will focus on the first three\.

# Confidence interval (interpretation)

95% confidence interval

__Correct __  __interpretation__

“If we were to repeat this research 100 times\, 95 of the confidence intervals would contain the true population mean\.”

This is called the long run probability\.

Based on the idea that we could repeat the experiment many times

95% of these replications provide an interval that contains the population value

We do not know if this particular interval contains the population value\!

# Confidence interval (width)

  * CIs for different confidence levels estimating glasses alcohol
  * The more confidence desired\, the wider the CI
  * The more confidence desired\, the less precise the estimation
  * _“we buy confidence with imprecision” _

# Confidence interval (SPSS)

Remember that we calculated: 95% C\.I\. = \(20\.68\, 32\.46\)

![](img%5CLecture%2014_BE10.png)

Confidence interval for what?

Reported is the CI for the mean difference compared to H0: mu = 20

To get the CI add the test value to both the lower and upper boundary:

_20 \+ _  <span style="color:#00B0F0">0\.6790 </span> = 20\.679 _20 \+ _  <span style="color:#00B0F0">12\.4639 </span> = 32\.464

Take a look at the  _p_ \-values\. Were you right?

# Why confidence intervals?

Confidence intervals should usually be reported in scientific literature\. Why?

With confidence intervals we do not limit ourselves to point estimates\, but we acknowledge the fact that there is uncertainty in our estimation\.

Some researchers passionately encourage the use of confidence intervals: [link1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL1RqHrZQ8)

Others are more skeptical: [link2](http://www.timvanderzee.com/not-interpret-confidence-intervals/)

# That’s all folks!

* This was the final lecture of the course Statistics 1 & 2 for LAS\.
* Lab session on Friday: practice with confidence intervals\.
* Plenty of time to study for the exam\!
    * 36 MC questions \(27 questions common part; 9 questions major specific part\); 3 hours
    * Covers the material we discussed in class
    * Practice exam questions \+ workbook on Canvas
    * Practice until your fingers fall off
* Q&A session: Next week on Tuesday?
    * Send your questions via email before the session\.
  * Don’t forget to fill out the course evaluation\!
* Good luck\!
