"An HR advisor is looking for new employees for LEGO. He thinks it is important for them to be creative. Creativity is normally distributed in the population, with a mean of 180 and a standard deviation of 25. A higher score indicates higher creativity. The advisor only wants to select applicants that belong to the 0.015 proportion of most creative people. What cut-off/boundary score for creativity should the HR advisor use?", "234.25", "125.75", "206.13", "180.38", "Find the Z-score that matches a right tail probability of .015, and calculate $(Z*25) + 180$",
"What is probability?", "The proportion of times an outcome would be observed in a random experiment, if it were repeated many times.", "The proportion of times an outcome was observed in a sample.", "A measure of association between two categorical variables.", "The subjective chance of observing a specific outcome in a single random experiment.", "(The frequentist definition of) probability builds upon the idea that you could theoretically repeat the random experiment many times, and calculate the proportion of times a given outcome is observed",
"What is a random experiment?", "A process with multiple potential outcomes that could be repeated under similar conditions.", "An example of the experimental method, where people are assigned to a treatment- or control group.", "Any process with multiple potential outcomes where the probability of each outcome is unknown.", "A naturally occurring experiment; for example, comparing participants who grow up in an area where the drinking water is rich in a particular mineral with control participants from another area.", "A random experiment is a process with multiple potential outcomes that could theoretically be repeated many times under similar conditions.",
"What are discrete random variables?", "Variables with a finite or countable number of possible outcomes.", "Variables with an infinite number of possible outcomes.", "Variables with a normal distribution.", "Variables with a probability distribution.", "*Discrete* random variables have a finite (=discrete) or countable number of possible outcomes.",
"What information is contained in a frequency distribution?", "A summary of the observed counts of discrete outcomes in a sample.", "A summary of observed probabilities of discrete outcomes in a sample.", "A measure of association between two categorical variables.", "A summary of the observed counts of discrete outcomes in the population.", "Frequency distributions are used to summarize observed outcomes in a sample.",
"What is the standard normal distribution?", "A standardized version of the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.", "A probability distribution where the total probability sums to 1.", "A contingency table summarizing two categorical variables.", "Any continuous distribution with infinite possible outcomes.", "The standard normal distribution is a standardized version of the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.",
"A researcher is interested in the relationship between movie watched and popcorn consumption. She counts the number of people who consume popcorn during a movie, and whether they have watched “Mean Girls”. The results are presented in the table below this quiz. What is P(Popcorn|Mean Girls), rounded to 3 decimal places?", "0.63", "0.08", "0.06", "0.04", "The question is about the *conditional probability* of having popcorn given that (|) someone watched mean girls; divide the 151 pp who match this description by the total number of people who watched mean girls."
