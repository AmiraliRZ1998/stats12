"What is the purpose of dummy coding in regression with binary predictors?", "To estimate the mean of the reference category and test the difference between categories.", "To convert binary variables into continuous variables.", "To increase the number of predictors in the model.", "To simplify the model by removing categorical predictors.", "Dummy coding allows regression to include binary predictors by assigning numerical values to each category, estimating the mean of the reference category, and testing the difference between categories.",
"What does the slope coefficient (b) represent in regression with a binary predictor?", "The difference in means between the two categories.", "The intercept of the reference category.", "The mean of the second category.", "The ratio of the two categories' means.", "The slope coefficient (b) in regression with a binary predictor represents the difference in means between the two categories, indicating how much the dependent variable changes when the binary predictor changes from 0 to 1.",
"Which assumption is not relevant for the independent samples t-test and bivariate linear regression with only a binary predictor?", "Linearity of relationship between X and Y", "Normality of residuals", "Homoscedasticity", "Independence of observations", "The assumption of linearity is not relevant, because the difference between two binary values of the predictor is linear by definition.",
"What does the Levene's test check in the context of the independent samples t-test?", "Equality of variances in both groups.", "Normality of residuals.", "Normality of variances in both groups.", "Linearity of relationship between X and Y.", "Levene's test checks the assumption of equality of variances in both groups for the independent samples t-test.",
"How is the independent samples t-test related to the t-test of the slope in regression with a binary predictor?", "They are equivalent.", "They are not related.", "The independent samples t-test is a subset of the t-test of the slope.", "The t-test of the slope is a subset of the independent samples t-test.", "The independent samples t-test and the t-test of the slope in regression with a binary predictor are equivalent tests that compare means between two independent groups.",
"What does the p-value in the context of the independent samples t-test indicate?", "The probability of observing a group difference at least as extreme as the one observed, if the null hypothesis is true.", "The probability of observing a statistically significant result.", "The probability that the null hypothesis is rejected.", "The probability that the null hypothesis is true.", "The p-value indicates the probability of observing a group difference at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.",
"What does Cohen's d represent?", "An effect size for the mean difference, expressed in number of standard deviations.", "A measure of explained variance for mean differences.", "The difference between the two categories' means.", "An effect size for the difference between standardized group means.", "Cohen's d is an effect size that standardizes the difference between group means by the (pooled) standard deviation, making it interpretable on a meaningful scale.",
"What is the recommended approach when assumption checks for homoscedasticity are significant?", "It depends - in exploratory analyses, you may switch to a robust test; in confirmatory analyses, you would report the violation and proceed as planned.", "It depends - in confirmatory analyses, you may switch to a robust test; in exploratory analyses, you would report the violation and proceed as planned.", "Use a robust t-test.", "Exclude outliers to ensure homoscedasticity.", "Assumption checks can alert you that important assumptions of the test are violated, but you should not blindly adapt analyses based on their results either - particularly in confirmatory research. You can always perform a sensitivity analysis in which you report both the planned analysis and the robust version.",
"The observed mean difference between two groups is 2.50, and Cohen's D is 1.25. What is the pooled standard deviation?", "2", "1.25", "2.50", "Can't say based on this information.", "Cohen's D = mean difference/pooled sd.",
"A researcher accidentally coded a dummy variable as 0 and 2, instead of 0 and 1. The regression equation is Y = 5.66 + 3*D. What is the mean value of the group coded 2?", "11.66", "8.66", "7.16", "3", "The slope tells you how much the predicted value goes up for a 1-unit increase in the predictor D. Since D is coded 0 and 2, a 1-unit increase only gets you halfway!"
