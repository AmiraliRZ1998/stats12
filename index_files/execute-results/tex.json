But aside from the challenges, it also offers opportunities. In adapting this course, we kept two goals in mind: increasing the alignment between the way of teaching and the learning goals, and ensuring high-quality interaction among students and between the students and teachers while still using online communication. Based on these goals, we made the following changes:\n\n1. During the course, you will be working in learning teams to promote interaction among students and peer support\n2. The two in-person exams (4 hours each) are replaced with take-home assignments: Two group assignments, and one individual assignment.\n\n\n### Why group assignments?\n\nContact with fellow students is a key aspect of the university experience.\nWe want to stimulate you to engage with the material and with one another.\nTherefore, the portfolio assignments are made in groups.\nThere are also aspects of learning in groups that can really improve your knowledge, like peer feedback.\nTo ensure that every group member pulls their weight, the final exam tests each student's individual comprehension of all material covered in the portfolios.\n\nGroups comprise 3-5 members and are assigned randomly when the course starts.\nHowever, it is allowed to switch with a consenting member of another group,\nor to join/merge with another small group if your group has become smaller than 3 members.\nThere are three portfolio registration deadlines. At this point, one group member submits the definitive group composition via a Google form.\n\n### Why use portfolio assessment?\n\nPortfolio assignments are well-suited for a skills-based course like Statistics 1 & 2.\nThey also take a lot of the pressure off because you can work at your own pace, and keep improving the work until it is good enough. We entrust you with the responsibility of making  these portfolio assignments in good faith, without instrumental assistance from outside your group or plagiarism, so I kindly ask you to make good on this trust, and hand in original work to show what you’ve learned.\n\n### Use of AI for making assignments\n\nThere is, in principle, nothing wrong with using AI-based tools like ChatGPT,\nas you will also have access to them in your working life - but be warned:\nwhen you use ChatGPT, it is your responsibility to thoroughly check its output for logical consistency and correctness.\nYou may not yet have the level of expertise required to know when ChatGPT generates irrelevant nonsense - but the teacher who grades your work does.\nConsider this carefully when deciding what makes more sense: doing your work manually, making sure each step is correct - or outsourcing it to AI, and then checking its work before submitting.\n\n## Grading\n\nYour grade is based on three portfolio assignments made in groups,\nand one individual exam to test comprehension of the material covered in the portfolios.\n\n### Portfolios 40% (3 x 13.3%)\n\nYou work on the portfolio assignments with your group, both during the lab sessions and outside of class. You hand in your group’s portfolio assignment before the set deadline, at which point it is graded. If your grade is below the passing level of 5.5, your group will have the opportunity to revise the portfolio based on teacher feedback to receive a maximum grade of 6.\n\n### Exam 60% \n\nTo make sure that all students are equally involved in the making of the portfolio assignments, an individual exam assesses comprehension of the material covered therein. It is a digital multiple choice exam. You may bring all course materials to the exam, including the portfolio. The exam consists of a common part and a major-specific part. Note: As per university policy, a guessing correction is applied to your grade.\n\n## Assignments \n\nA description of the assignments follows below.\nFor each assignment, every element labeled with a lower case letter is graded fail (0 points), pass (1 point), or excellent (1.5 points).\nGrades are summed for each assignment, and rescaled from 1-10.\nThe final grade is a weighted average across assignments of the rescaled grades (weights in %).\nNote that the assignments are **not** full-length papers!\nYou only get 200 words to justify your theoretical model, and 300 words to discuss the results.\nThe focus should be on your analysis; how it relates to theory (introduction), and what you have learned from it and how you might improve it (discussion).\n\n1. Apply the “latent variable model” to a real-life problem, where observed variables do not directly measure, but are indicators of, an unobserved social scientific construct (G, 25%)\n    a. Find a suitable dataset, for example: (no word limit)\n        i.\tData you have collected for a previous course\n        ii.\tOpen data, provided with a published paper\n        iii.\tThe “Coping with COVID-19” dataset (if you can’t find anything)\n    b.\tDescribe the dataset, and introduce the theoretical latent variable model (200 words)\n    c.\tEstimate the latent variable model (PCA, EFA, CFA) and conduct reliability analysis, provide relevant output in a suitable format (no word limit; as short as possible and as long as necessary to report the relevant output)\n    d.\tExplain your rationale for important modeling decisions (300 words)\n        i.\tMotivate your choice for the type of latent variable model\n        ii.\tDiscuss assumptions\n        iii.\tDiscuss other important decisions, as discussed in the course reading materials\n    e.\tReport and interpret the results in APA style  (no word limit; as short as possible and as long as necessary to report the relevant results)\n    f.\tDiscuss the results in max 300 words\n        i.\tDevote attention to strengths and limitations\n2. Use the “path model” to describe how several variables are causally related to one another (G, 25%)\n    a.\tFind a suitable dataset, for example: (no word limit)\n        i.\tData you have collected and analyzed for a previous course\n        ii.\tOpen data, provided with a published paper\n        iii.\tThe “Coping with COVID-19” dataset (if you can’t find anything)\n    b.\tDescribe the dataset, and introduce the theoretical path model (200 words)\n    c.\tConduct a SEM path model to answer the theoretical questions  (no word limit; as short as possible and as long as necessary to report the relevant output)\n        i. \tThis can be a re-analysis of a question that had been tested using regression, ANOVA, or t-test analysis in the original paper\n    d.\tExplain your rationale for important modeling decisions (300 words)\n        i.\tFit between theory and model\n        ii.\tModel assumptions\n        iii.\tDifference/similarity between the path model and the (original) regression, ANOVA, or t-test analysis\n        iv.\tWhy you use standardized or unstandardized coefficients\n    e.\tReport and interpret the results in APA style  (no word limit; as short as possible and as long as necessary to report the relevant results)\n        i. \tInclude measures of explained variance for the dependent variables.\n    f.\tDiscuss the results (max 300 words)\n        i.\tDevote attention to strengths and limitations\n3.
