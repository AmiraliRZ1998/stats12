"Introversion is normally distributed with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. What is the probability that the mean introversion level of a randomly selected group of 16 people is smaller than 52? Round the answer to 3 decimal places.","0.788","0.655","0.345","0.045","Calculate the standard error as 10/sqrt(16). Then, calculate the Z-score as (52-50)/SE. Find the right tailed probability of that Z-score, then calculate 1 minus that probability.",
"Variable X is not normally distributed in the population. Variable X has a population mean of 30 and a population standard deviation of 6. A random sample of N = 36 scores is drawn from the population for variable X. The sample mean is equal to 32. Which of the following statements about the sampling distribution of the sample means for this sample (n = 36) is incorrect?", "The mean of the sampling distribution of the sample means is equal to 32.", "The sampling distribution of sample means is approximately normally distributed.", "The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample means is equal to 1.", "The standard error is smaller than the population standard deviation.", "The sampling distribution will be approximately normal because n >= 30. The SE is indeed 1, because sigma/sqrt(n) = 6 /sqrt(36) = 1. The SE is always smaller than sigma, because it is calculated as sigma divided by square root of n.",
"What does the sampling distribution represent?","A theoretical distribution of sample statistics","The distribution of population parameters","The distribution of raw data","The distribution of sample means","The sampling distribution represents the distribution of sample statistics, such as sample means or proportions, derived from multiple samples drawn from the same population. It provides insights into the variability and characteristics of these sample statistics.",
"Which of the following statements about the sampling distribution is true?","The sampling distribution is centered around the population parameter","The sampling distribution is identical to the population distribution","The sampling distribution of a skewed variable is also skewed","The sampling distribution is based on a single sample","The sampling distribution is centered around the population parameter.",
"What is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution called?","Standard error","Population standard deviation","Variance","Bias","The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is known as the standard error. It measures the average variability or spread of sample statistics around the population parameter, reflecting the precision of the estimation.",
"How does sample size affect the shape of the sampling distribution?","Larger sample sizes result in smaller standard errors","Larger sample sizes make the sampling distribution more spread out","Larger sample sizes increase the variability of sample statistics","Larger sample sizes have no impact on the sampling distribution","Larger sample sizes result in smaller standard errors. As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution becomes more concentrated around the population parameter, leading to a decrease in the standard error. This implies that larger samples provide more precise estimates of the population parameter."
"What is the probability that a sample mean falls within +/- 1 standard deviation of the population mean, assuming a normal distribution of sample means?","0.68","0.34","0.95","0.48","The probability that a sample mean falls within +/- 1 standard deviations of the population mean, assuming a normal distribution of sample means, is 68%. This is based on 'the empirical rule'.",
"If the standard deviation of the population is 10 and the sample size is 25, what is the standard error of the sample mean?","2","0.4","0.2","5","The standard error of the sample mean is 2. The standard error can be calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the population by the square root of the sample size. In this case, it would be 10 / âˆš25 = 2.",
"What is the probability that the sample proportion falls within +/- 2 standard deviations of the population proportion, assuming a large sample size?","0.95","0.68","0.34","0.48","The key lesson here is that everything you learned about the sampling distribution also applies to other statistics than the mean, so according to the empirical rule, 95% of sample proportions will fall within +/- 2 standard deviation of the population proportion.",
"If the standard deviation of the population is 5 and the sample size is 50, what is the standard error of the sample mean?","0.707","0.141","0.0707","0.283","The standard error of the sample mean is SD/sqrt(n), so 5/sqrt(50) = .707"
