"In Repeated Measures ANOVA, what type of experimental design involves the same participants being exposed to multiple conditions?", "Within-participants design", "Between-participants design", "Cross-sectional design", "Longitudinal design", "In a within-participants design, the same participants are exposed to different conditions, allowing for the comparison of outcomes within the same individuals.",
"Which of these is NOT a methodological concern in within-participants designs?", "Interaction effects", "Order effects", "Learning effects", "Historical effects", "Order effects refer to the potential impact of the sequence in which conditions are presented on the observed outcomes. Learning effects imply that participants respond to a questionnaire differently when they already know the questions. Historical effects mean that something external happens while you are running the experiment. Interaction effects are a statistical term.",
"How does the Latin square design address order effects in experiments?", "Controls for order effects by ensuring each condition appears once in every position", "Randomly assigns participants to different conditions", "Manipulates the order of conditions for experimental purposes", "Selects a single condition for all participants", "The Latin square design helps control for order effects by ensuring that each condition appears in each position within the order an equal number of times.",
"What is the primary advantage of within-participants designs in comparison to between-participants designs?", "Elimination of variability due to individual differences from the error term", "Greater external validity", "Larger sample sizes", "Lower cost", "Within-participants designs allow each participant to serve as their own control, effectively removing variability due to individual differences from the error term. The cost is often indeed lower, but that's not the primary advantage.",
"What statistical technique is commonly used to analyze data collected in within-participants designs with two repeated measurements?", "Paired samples t-test", "Independent samples t-test", "Chi-square test", "Analysis of variance", "The paired samples t-test is used to analyze the differences between two related measurements, such as pretest and posttest scores.",
"What assumption of the general linear model is violated when analyzing data with repeated measurements?", "Independence of errors", "Homogeneity of variances", "Normal distribution of errors", "Linearity of relationships", "Repeated measurements within the same individuals violate the assumption of independence of errors, as observations from the same participant are likely to be correlated.",
"What is the purpose of using a multivariate approach in analyzing data with more than two repeated measurements?", "To perform a test that is robust to violations of sphericity", "To calculate mean differences between measurements", "To assess the order effects in the data", "To ignore the repeated measurements", "A multivariate approach is robust to the assumption of sphericity because it considers the interrelationships between different repeated measurements, treating them as correlated outcomes.",
"What is the key assumption in the multivariate approach for analyzing data with repeated measurements?", "Sphericity assumption", "Normality assumption", "Homoscedasticity assumption", "Independence assumption", "The sphericity assumption assumes that the variances and correlations among all pairs of repeated measurements are equal, which is essential for accurate results.",
"In mixed design ANOVA, what type of factors are considered?", "Both within-participants and between-participants factors", "Only within-participants factors", "Only between-participants factors", "Categorical and continuous factors", "Mixed design ANOVA involves the consideration of both within-participants and between-participants factors to understand the interactions between these factors on the outcomes.",
"What does the term 'sphericity' refer to in the context of repeated measures ANOVA?", "Equal variances and correlations of differences scores of all pairs of repeated measurements", "The shape of the distribution of the outcomes", "The distribution of the residuals", "The distribution of the predictor variables", "Sphericity refers to the assumption that the variances and correlations among all difference scores between pairs of repeated measurements are equal, which is crucial for accurate analysis."
