"What does a confidence interval represent in statistics?","A range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall.","The exact value of the population parameter.","The average value of the sample data.","The highest value in the sample data.","A confidence interval represents a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall.",
"How is the confidence level of a confidence interval chosen?","The researcher determines the desired level of confidence in capturing the true parameter.","By using standard values such as 95% or 99%.","By the size of the sample data.","By the range of values in the sample data.","The confidence level of a confidence interval is chosen by the researcher to determine the desired level of confidence in capturing the true parameter.",
"What does a wider confidence interval indicate?","Greater uncertainty or less precision in estimating the population parameter.","Higher confidence in the accuracy of the estimate.","Smaller sample size.","A narrower range of values in the sample data.","A wider confidence interval indicates greater uncertainty or less precision in estimating the population parameter.",
"In general, as the sample size increases, what happens to the width of the confidence interval?","It decreases.","It increases.","It remains unchanged.","It becomes equal to the population parameter.","As the sample size increases, the width of the confidence interval decreases, indicating increased precision in estimating the parameter.",
"What is the relationship between the width of a confidence interval and the level of confidence?","Inverse relationship: Higher confidence leads to a wider interval.","Direct relationship: Higher confidence leads to a narrower interval.","No relationship: Width and confidence level are independent.","Width and confidence level are equal.","The relationship between the width of a confidence interval and the level of confidence is inverse: higher confidence leads to a wider interval."
"What is the purpose of a confidence interval in hypothesis testing?","One can reject a null hypothesis whose hypothesized value lies outside of a X% confidence interval, with a p-value smaller than = 1-(X/100).","One can reject a null hypothesis whose hypothesized value lies outside of a X% confidence interval, with a p-value smaller than = X/100.","One can reject a null hypothesis whose hypothesized value lies outside of a X% confidence interval, with a p-value of 1-(X/100).","One can reject an alternative hypothesis whose hypothesized value lies outside of a X% confidence interval, with a p-value smaller than = 1-(X/100).", "The purpose of a confidence interval in hypothesis testing is to assess the range of values where the population parameter might lie and make decisions about hypotheses.",
"A researcher collected data from a sample of 80 participants. The sample mean is 72, and the standard deviation is 2.5. What is the 95% confidence interval?","[72.45, 72.55]","[71.72, 72.28]", "[67.10, 76.90]", "[69.50, 74.50]", "The standard error of the sample mean is calculated by dividing the standard deviation (2.5) by the square root of the sample size; add +/- 1.96* the standard error to the mean.",
"What is the correct statement about a 95% confidence interval?", "The 95% confidence interval is a procedure with 95% probability of providing an interval that contains the population value.", "The 95% confidence interval contains the population value with 95% probability.", "95% of all confidence intervals contain the population value.", "There is a 95% probability that the population value is larger than the lower bound and smaller than the upper bound of the confidence interval.", "The probability is in the procedure of calculating a confidence interval. We cannot make any probability statements about the population value, or about the results of specific confidence intervals."
