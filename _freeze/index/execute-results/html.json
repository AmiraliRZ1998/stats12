    "markdown": "# Overview {.unnumbered}\n\nThis course covers the basics of statistics and data analysis.\nThe ability to extract insights from data is an essential skill for both academic and non-academic work, and \"data literacy\" is increasingly important in a world where data are collected about every aspect of our lives.\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to independently analyze data,\ninterpret and report your findings,\nand assess the results of analyses performed by others, such as you might find in scientific articles.\n\nThis GitBook contains all relevant information about this course.\nIt is assumed that every student reads it carefully.\nIf you have any questions, first consult this GitBook,\nthen ask a fellow student, and only if your question is still not answered,\nthen contact the course coordinator.\n\nCommunication about the course occurs through Canvas (Login with your student ID and password).\n\n## Course overview\n\nThe **course schedule** is available on Osiris.

Caspar J. van Lissa](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/medewerkers/c-j-vanlissa)\n\n**Lab sessions**\n\n(Thu) Tra Lê\n\n<!-- ## Teaching Philosophy -->\n\n<!-- The corona crisis is challenging all of us to rethink how we teach and learn. But aside from the challenges, it also offers opportunities. In adapting this course, we kept two goals in mind: increasing the alignment between the way of teaching and the learning goals, and ensuring high-quality interaction among students and between the students and teachers while still using online communication. Based on these goals, we made the following changes: -->\n\n<!-- 1. During the course, you will be working in learning teams to promote interaction among students and peer support -->\n<!-- 2. The two in-person exams (4 hours each) are replaced with take-home assignments: Two group assignments, and one individual assignment. -->\n\n\n### Why group assignments?\n\nContact with fellow students is a key aspect of the university experience.\nWe want to stimulate you to engage with the material and with one another.\nTherefore, the portfolio assignments are made in groups.\nThere are also aspects of learning in groups that can really improve your knowledge, like peer feedback.\nTo ensure that every group member pulls their weight, the final exam tests each student's individual comprehension of all material covered in the portfolios.\n\nGroups comprise 3-5 members and are assigned randomly when the course starts.\nHowever, it is allowed to switch with a consenting member of another group,\nor to join/merge with another small group if your group has become smaller than 3 members.\nThere are three portfolio registration deadlines. At this point, one group member submits the definitive group composition via a Google form.\n\n### Why use portfolio assessment?\n\nPortfolio assignments are well-suited for a skills-based course like Statistics 1 & 2.\nThey also take a lot of the pressure off because you can work at your own pace, and keep improving the work until it is good enough. We entrust you with the responsibility of making  these portfolio assignments in good faith, without instrumental assistance from outside your group or plagiarism, so I kindly ask you to make good on this trust, and hand in original work to show what you’ve learned.\n\n### Statement on using AI for assignments\n\nThere is, in principle, nothing wrong with using AI-based tools like ChatGPT,\nas you will also have access to them in your working life - but be warned:\nwhen you use ChatGPT, it is your responsibility to thoroughly check its output for logical consistency and correctness.\nYou may not yet have the level of expertise required to know when ChatGPT generates irrelevant nonsense - but the teacher who grades your work does.\nConsider this carefully when deciding what makes more sense: doing your work manually, making sure each step is correct - or outsourcing it to AI, and then checking its work before submitting.\n\n## Grading\n\nYour grade is based on three portfolio assignments made in groups,\nand one individual exam to test comprehension of the material covered in the portfolios.\n\n### Portfolios 40% (3 x 13.3%)\n\nYou work on the portfolio assignments with your group, both during the lab sessions and outside of class. You hand in your group’s portfolio assignment before the set deadline, at which point it is graded. If your grade is below the passing level of 5.5, your group will have the opportunity to revise the portfolio based on teacher feedback to receive a maximum grade of 6.\n\n### Exam 60% \n\nTo make sure that all students are equally involved in the making of the portfolio assignments, an individual exam assesses comprehension of the material covered therein. It is a digital multiple choice exam. You may bring all course materials to the exam, including the portfolio. The exam consists of a common part and a major-specific part. Note: As per university policy, a guessing correction is applied to your grade.\n\n## Assignments \n\nBelow is a description of the assignments.\nFor each assignment, every element labeled with a lower case letter is graded fail (0 points), pass (1 point), or excellent (1.5 points).\nGrades are summed for each assignment, and rescaled from 1-10.\nThe final grade is the average across assignments of the rescaled grades.\nNote the stated word limit for each section.\nIf you can write a good report with fewer words, that's fine.\nIf you exceed the word limit however,\nyour grade for that section cannot exceed a pass (1 point).\n\nThe focus of the assignments should me on motivating, reporting, interpreting, and discussing your analyses.\nYou will get a good grade for well-reasoned and discussed analyses.\n\nSee the Appendices section to access data sources for the assignment.\n\n### Assignment 1\n\nDescriptive statistics and statistical inference\n\na.
