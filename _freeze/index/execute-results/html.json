Caspar J. van Lissa](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/medewerkers/c-j-vanlissa)\n\n**Lab sessions**\n\n(Thu) Tra Lê\n\n\n<!-- ## Teaching Philosophy -->\n\n<!-- The corona crisis is challenging all of us to rethink how we teach and learn. But aside from the challenges, it also offers opportunities. In adapting this course, we kept two goals in mind: increasing the alignment between the way of teaching and the learning goals, and ensuring high-quality interaction among students and between the students and teachers while still using online communication. Based on these goals, we made the following changes: -->\n\n<!-- 1. During the course, you will be working in learning teams to promote interaction among students and peer support -->\n<!-- 2. The two in-person exams (4 hours each) are replaced with take-home assignments: Two group assignments, and one individual assignment. -->\n\n\n### Why group assignments?\n\nContact with fellow students is a key aspect of the university experience.\nWe want to stimulate you to engage with the material and with one another.\nTherefore, the portfolio assignments are made in groups.\nThere are also aspects of learning in groups that can really improve your knowledge, like peer feedback.\nTo ensure that every group member pulls their weight, the final exam tests each student's individual comprehension of all material covered in the portfolios.\n\nGroups comprise 3-5 members and are assigned randomly when the course starts.\nHowever, it is allowed to switch with a consenting member of another group,\nor to join/merge with another small group if your group has become smaller than 3 members.\nThere are three portfolio registration deadlines. At this point, one group member submits the definitive group composition via a Google form.\n\n### Why use portfolio assessment?\n\nPortfolio assignments are well-suited for a skills-based course like Statistics 1 & 2.\nThey also take a lot of the pressure off because you can work at your own pace, and keep improving the work until it is good enough. We entrust you with the responsibility of making  these portfolio assignments in good faith, without instrumental assistance from outside your group or plagiarism, so I kindly ask you to make good on this trust, and hand in original work to show what you’ve learned.\n\n## Grading\n\n<span id=\"grading\">\nYour grade is based on two components:\n\n1. *A portfolio* composed of three assignments made in groups, and\n2. *An individual exam*, split into three sessions, to test comprehension of the material covered in the portfolios.\n\n**A grade of 5.5 or higher is required for both components to pass the course.**\n\nThe first occasion for the exam is split into three sessions, administered throughout the semester, for the following reasons:\n\n* To reduce study load by administering small tests shortly after the material is taught\n* To ensure continued engagement with the course\n* To give students feedback on their current level of understanding\n\nWhile you do receive an informal grade for each session, the final grade is simply calculated based on your correct answers in all sessions. If that grade falls below 5.5, you can take a resit which covers the material of the entire exam (all 3 sessions).\n\n### Portfolios 40% (3 x 13.3%)\n\nYou work on the portfolio assignments with your group, both during the lab sessions and outside of class.\nFor each assignment, register your group membership before the set deadline at <http://tiny.cc/stats12_portfolio>.\nYou hand in your group’s portfolio assignment before the set deadline, at which point it is graded. If your grade is below the passing level of 5.5, your group will have the opportunity to revise the portfolio based on teacher feedback to receive a maximum grade of 6.\n\nGroups should equally distribute the work load for the portfolio assignments. In case doubts are raised about the equal distribution of labor in a particular group, the portfolio assignment in question will be supplemented with individual oral examination and an individual grade, which can not exceed the original grade for the group assignment. In other words, failing to distribute the work properly can not have positive effects, but it can have negative effects on your grade. To prevent this, make clear agreements about the distribution of work with your group mates.\n\n### Exam 60% \n\nTo make sure that all students are equally involved in the making of the portfolio assignments, an individual exam assesses comprehension of the material covered therein. It is a digital multiple choice exam.\n\n<!--Note that some of the questions are developed by you, the students (see portfolio)! You thus have an advantage if you develop questions that are good enough to be on the exam.-->\n\n<!--You may bring all course materials to the exam, including the portfolio. The exam consists of a common part and a major-specific part. Note: As per university policy, a guessing correction is applied to your grade.-->\n\n</span>\n\n<!-- **Note: I recommend that you download the GitBook onto a USB stick so you have access during your exam!**-->\n\n## Assignments \n\nBelow is a description of the assignments.\nFor each assignment, every element labeled with a lower case letter is graded fail (0 points), pass (1 point), or excellent (1.5 points).\nGrades are summed for each assignment, and rescaled from 1-10.\nThe final grade is the average across assignments of the rescaled grades.\nNote the stated word limit for each section.\nIf you can write a good report with fewer words, that's fine.\nIf you exceed the word limit however,\nyour grade for that section cannot exceed a pass (1 point).\n\nThe focus of the assignments should me on motivating, reporting, interpreting, and discussing your analyses.\nYou will get a good grade for well-reasoned and discussed analyses.\n\nSee the Appendices section to access data sources for the assignment.\n\n### Assignment 1\n\nDescriptive statistics and statistical inference\n\na. Select at least three variables for further analysis, and motivate your selection based on theory, using at least one reference to explain why are you interested in the properties of the selected variables (150 words)\n    i.\tInclude one continuous variable\n    ii.\tInclude one nominal variable\n    iii.\tInclude one ordinal variable\nb.\tDescribe the dataset (200 words + tables/figures)\n    i. Use appropriate univariate descriptive statistics for all variables\n    ii. Plot data using appropriate plots\n    iii. Include at least one frequency- or crosstable\nc.\tFor a continuous variable:\n    i. Select one or more values with clinical/societal/statistical relevance (i.e., provide some justification for the choice of value)\n    ii. Using probability calculus, calculate and report the probability of observing values that fall below/between/exceed the chosen value(s)\nd.  For a continuous variable:\n    i. Formulate a specific null- and alternative hypothesis\n    ii. Report a one-sample t-test or Z-test for the specific null-hypothesis\n    iii. Calculate the probability of comitting a Type II error\nd.\tDiscuss your analyses (300 words)\n    i. Explain your rationale for important modeling decisions\n    ii.\tMotivate your choice for the type of statistics and analyses\n    iii. Discuss assumptions\n    iv.\tDiscuss what you have learned from it and how you might improve it \ne.\tUse APA style throughout your report\nf.  Reflect on the group process (300 words). Note: I will grade your *reflection*, not your *process*. So: if your group's process is not working well, but you reflect on it properly, you can still get full marks for this component. Use Gibbs' Reflective Cycle:\n    i. Describe what happened during the group work\n    ii. Explain how you felt during the group work\n    iii. Look at the good and bad aspects of the group work\n    iv. What were the obstacles you experienced? What factors contributed to success?\n    v. What could you have done differently to improve the situation?\n    vi. What are your intentions to make the next group assignment work (even) better?\n    \n<!--f.  Create four multiple choice questions about the first 4 weeks. You can use some of your analyses as inspiration, or make the questions purely about understanding. The best questions will be part of the real exam, so you have an advantage if you make questions that are good, but that you can still answer correctly!\n    i. Introduction to statistics\n    ii. Probability\n    iii. Sampling distribution\n    iv. Testing\n\nThe multiple choice questions must be in plain text (no images or special characters, in the format below. You can just copy-paste this into the (Word?) document of your assignment:\n\n```\nquestion = \"This is the question\",\nanswer = \"This is the correct answer\",\ndistractor1 = \"This is an incorrect distractor answer\",\ndistractor2 = \"This is an incorrect distractor answer\",\ndistractor3 = \"This is an incorrect distractor answer\",\nexpanation = \"Why is the correct answer correct?\"\n```\n--> \n\n### Assignment 2\n\nGeneral linear model\n\na. Select at least three variables for further analysis, and using at least one reference, explain what research questions you will investigate and what hypotheses you will test (150 words)\n    i.\tInclude one continuous outcome variable\n    ii.\tInclude one continuous predictor\n    iii.\tInclude one nominal or ordinal predictor\nb.\tConstruct a model with only the continuous predictor (200 words)\n    i. Report and interpret the different sums of squares\n    ii. Report and interpret the explained variance\n    iii. Conduct a separate correlation analysis.

As a result, my experience is that e.g. ChatGPT produces a lot of incorrect output for statistics assignments.\n\nIf you decide to use LLMs, it is your responsibility to thoroughly check its output for logical consistency and correctness. You may not yet have the level of expertise required to know when ChatGPT generates irrelevant nonsense - but the teacher who grades your work does. Consider this carefully when deciding what makes more sense: doing your work manually, making sure each step is correct - or outsourcing it to AI, and then checking its work before submitting.\n\n\n## Credit\n\nThis book was authored by Caspar J.
