In this lecture, we will focus on bivariate linear regression, which describes a linear relationship between a continuous outcome variable and a continuous predictor. However, it's important to note that the GLM encompasses other members that can handle predictors of any measurement level (continuous or categorical), multiple predictors, transformations of the outcome and predictors, and different error distributions.\n\nLinear regression is based on the concept of using information about other variables associated with the outcome to improve predictions. It begins with the understanding that the mean is the best predictor (expected value) when no further relevant information is available. However, if we have information about other variables, such as the number of hours studied being strongly associated with exam grades, we can use that information to enhance our predictions. This process is known as regression.\n\nTo visually explore associations between two variables, we often use scatterplots. Scatterplots require both variables to be at least of ordinal measurement level. By plotting the data points, we can observe whether there is a linear pattern or trend. In linear regression, we aim to find a line that represents the best possible predictions. This line, called the regression line, goes through the middle of the cloud of data points.\n\nThe regression line is described by the formula Y = a + bX, where \"a\" is the intercept (the predicted value when X equals 0) and \"b\" is the slope (how steeply the line increases or decreases). The predictions made using the regression line are not identical to the observed values, as there is always some prediction error. The Ordinary Least Squares method is used to obtain the line that minimizes the sum of squared prediction errors.\n\nIn a bivariate regression, the regression formula expands to include the individual prediction error, assuming that the errors are normally distributed around the regression line with a mean of zero. The regression model is represented as Yi = a + b * Xi + ei, where Yi is the individual's score on the dependent variable, a is the intercept, b is the slope, Xi is the individual's score on the independent variable, and ei is the individual prediction error.\n\nHypothesis tests can be conducted on the regression coefficients to determine their significance. The default null hypothesis for the intercept is that it is equal to zero, while the null hypothesis for the slope is also zero. The t-test is commonly used, with the degrees of freedom being n - p, where n is the sample size and p is the number of parameters. By testing the coefficients, we can determine the statistical significance of the relationship between the predictor and the outcome.\n\nWhile linear regression offers valuable insights, it is essential to consider the assumptions underlying the model. These assumptions include linearity of the relationship between the predictor and the outcome, normality of residuals (prediction errors), homoscedasticity (equal variance of residuals), and independence of observations. Violations of these assumptions can affect the validity of the model and lead to misleading results. Checking and addressing these assumptions is crucial for accurate and reliable regression analysis.\n\nLinear regression is a powerful tool for analyzing the relationship between variables,\nand a building block for many more advanced analysis techniques.\nIt allows us to make predictions based on available information and understand the strength and significance of the relationship between a continuous predictor and continuous outcome.\nBy considering the assumptions and conducting hypothesis tests, we can ensure the validity of our regression models and draw meaningful conclusions from the analysis.\n",
