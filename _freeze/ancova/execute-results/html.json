What's \"special\" about this technique is that it is commonly used when the predictor of interest is that categorical variable, and the continuous predictor(s) are so-called \"covariates\": predictors that are only included to improve our estimate of the effect of the categorical predictor of interest.\n\nYou will often see this technique used to analyze data from experiments or \"natural experiments\", where participants self-select into a treatment group.\n\nWhile ANCOVA is a useful technique, it comes with some serious pitfalls: any time control variables are used, we are making assumptions about causality. If these assumptions are incorrect, our estimates of the effect of interest will be (severely) biased.\n\n## Covariates and Their Role\n\nCovariates are variables that have a relationship with the dependent variable but are not the primary focus of the study. They are often referred to as control variables, as they help control for unwanted variability and improve the precision of the analysis. Examples of common covariates include age, gender, education level, or any other variables that might influence the dependent variable.\n\nIn terms of causality, it's crucial to consider the relationships between covariates, predictors, and the outcome variable. Control variables should ideally be confounders – variables that influence both the predictor of interest and the outcome. It's essential to avoid controlling for colliders, which are variables *caused by* both the predictor and the outcome. A thorough understanding of causal relationships is crucial for proper interpretation.\n\nOne reason why researchers use control variables in ANCOVA is because they reduce the residual variance in the outcome variable, which in turn increases the power to detect the effect of the predictor of interest. Another reason to use covariates is when the goal is making causal inferences, especially in quasi-experimental designs. The proper selection of covariates that enable causal inference requires careful consideration and is beyond the scope of this course.\n\n## Good, Neutral, and Bad Controls\n\nCovariates fall into different categories based on their relationship with the predictor of interest and the outcome. An example of a good control is a confounder: a variable that causes both the predictor and the outcome. These need to be controlled to avoid spurious relationships. An example of a neutral control is a covariate that is unrelated to the predictor but can reduce error variance in the outcome, thereby increasing statistical power. Bad controls, on the other hand, can introduce biases, such as collider bias (controlling for an outcome of predictor and outcome), case control bias (controlling for an outcome of the outcome), or overcontrol bias (controlling for a mediator of the effect of the focal predictor on the outcome).\n\nOne crucial insight is that in randomized controlled experiments, the random assignment of participants to different groups breaks the relationship between confounders and the treatment variable. This makes control variables related to the confounders unnecessary. Controlling for them could even introduce bias into the analysis.\n\n\n## Calculating Adjusted Means\n\nAdjusting for covariates involves calculating adjusted means – the means that groups would have had if they scored equally on the covariate. There are two ways to mathematically calculate the adjusted means. One way is to fill in the regression equation for the desired value of the covariate. \n\nThe other way is to calculate the adjusted means from the group means:\n\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_g^{adj} = \\bar{Y}_g - b(\\bar{X}_g-\\bar{X})\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n* $\\bar{Y}_g^{adj}$: Adjusted mean of the outcome for group g\n* $\\bar{Y}_g$: Unadjusted mean of the outcome for group g\n* $b$: Regression coefficient of the covariate\n* $\\bar{X}_g$: Group mean of covariate X\n* $\\bar{X}$: Overall mean of covariate X\n\n\nIn sum, ANCOVA is a different name for regression with a categorical predictor of interest, and continuous predictor(s) that are included to improve our estimate of the effect of the predictor of interest. ANCOVA can enhance statistical power and help make more accurate (potentiall causal) inferences. However, the careful selection of covariates and an understanding of causal relationships are paramount to its proper implementation and interpretation.\n\n# Formative Test\n\nA formative test helps you assess your progress in the course, and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material.

It specifies exactly the same model as we have been investigating, but its output is more focused on information that is typically requested when estimating a model with only categorical predictors and (optionally) interactions between them.\n\nWe will now use the ANOVA interface and pay special attention to output it gives us that is not directly available via the Regression interface.\n\nYou can either use the graphical user interface, or copy-paste this syntax. Either way, pay particular attention to the following:\n\n* Under Options, ask for Homogeneity tests: `/PRINT=HOMOGENEITY`\n* Under Options, ask for Estimates of effect size: `/PRINT=ETASQ`\n* Under Options, ask for Parameter Estimates: `/PRINT=PARAMETER`\n* Under EM Means (expected marginal means), ask for the means for the interaction, and compare Main effects: `/EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Behavior) ADJ(LSD)`\n\n\n```\nUNIANOVA Tip BY Behavior Gender\n  /METHOD=SSTYPE(3)\n  /INTERCEPT=INCLUDE\n  /PLOT=PROFILE(Behavior*Gender)\n  /PRINT=ETASQ HOMOGENEITY DESCRIPTIVE PARAMETER\n  /CRITERIA=ALPHA(.05)\n  /EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Behavior) ADJ(LSD)\n  /EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Gender) ADJ(LSD)\n  /DESIGN=Behavior Gender Behavior*Gender.\n```\n\nCopy and run this syntax.\n\nNote that the table labelled **Parameter Estimates** is identical to the Coefficients table from the previous regression analysis.\n\nAlso note that, for example, the F-value for the explained variance for the interaction between Gender an Behavior is identical to the F-value for the $\\Delta R^2$ test you performed in the previous hierarchical regression analysis.\n\n### Homoscedasticity\n\nRegression models have an assumption of homoscedasticity. If all predictors are categorical, that means that we assume equal variances in all groups.\n\nThe ANOVA output offers us a Levene's test for homogeneity of variance. Find it, and answer the following question:\n\nTrue or false: There is reason to doubt the assumption of homogeneity. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select>\n\nWhat is the value of the appropriate test statistic? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"1.644\"]'/>\n\n\nTrue or false: As a rule, the assumption of homogeneity is more likely to be violated in a factorial ANOVA with an unbalanced design (as compared to a balanced design). <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select>\n\n\n### Effect size\n\nWe can also calculate effect sizes $\\eta^2$ or partial $\\eta^2$, for the two factors and the interaction effect separately.\n\nRecall that $\\eta^2$ is just the explained variance, $R^2$. In other words: What proportion of the total sum of squares is explained by the factor of interest?\n\nWe obtain $\\eta^2$ for Factor A by dividing the sum of squares for factor A, $SS_A$, by the $SST$, which is labeled \"Corrected total\" in the ANOVA output: $\\eta^2 = \\frac{SS_A}{SST}$\n\nWhat is $\\eta^2$ for the interaction effect? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='4' data-answer='[\"0.23\",\".23\"]'/>\n  \nGo back to your previous nested model test, where you determined whether adding the interaction terms led to a significant improvement in explained variance, $\\Delta R^2$. Verify that this number is identical to the $\\eta^2$ for the interaction! They are the same thing.\n\n\nAnother measure of effect size is the partial $\\eta^2$. It tells us what proportion of the variance not explained by other factors is explained by the factor of interest.\n\nWe obtain $\\eta_p^2$ for Factor A by dividing the sum of squares for factor A, $SS_A$, by $SS_A$ plus the residual sum of squares $SSE$: $\\eta_p^2 = \\frac{SS_A}{SS_A+SSE}$.\n\nNote that SPSS allows us to request partial $\\eta^2$. We did so by including the line `/PRINT=ETASQ` in our syntax.\n\nWhat is the value of partial $\\eta^2$ for the factor Behavior? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.515\",\".515\"]'/>\n\n\n### Pairwise comparisons\n\nAnother unique feature of the ANOVA interface is that it gives us all pairwise comparisons when we ask for them using the code `/EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Behavior) ADJ(LSD)`\n\nNote that this line asks for comparisons of the three levels of behavior for each gender separately. You can also ask for comparisons of the two levels of gender for each behavior separately by specifying `COMPARE(Gender)` instead.\n\nInspect the table Pairwise Comparisons. The three experimental conditions are compared in a pairwise manner, split over the factor Gender.\n\nFor which pair of groups do the means differ significantly from one another (at the 5% level)? <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>Waiter: Small talk-Smiley</option><option value='answer'>Waitress: Neutral-Smiley</option><option value=''>Waiter: Neutral-Small talk</option><option value=''>Waiter: Neutral-Smiley</option></select> \n \nLook at the note under the table. True or false: the p-values in this table are adjusted for multiple comparisons. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>TRUE</option><option value='answer'>FALSE</option></select>\n\nWhy do we need to apply a correction like the Bonferroni correction?\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n\nWhen doing multiple tests on one sample, like doing these pairwise comparisons, the level of risk of a Type I error increases. To correct for this, we should use an adjusted alpha-level, such as the Bonferroni correction.\n\nAlthough it is possible to ask for SPSS to adjust the p-values in the table, I have expressly not instructed you to do so. The reason for this is that, strictly speaking, Bonferroni is an adjustment of the significance level $\\alpha$ - not of the p-values. Moreover, sometimes you conduct many more tests in a study aside from the pairwise comparisons performed here. In that case, you might want to include those in your Bonferroni correction too, and SPSS does not know about their existence when it applies a Bonferroni correction to the p-values.\n\nIn other words: It is better to set the alpha level yourself, and apply it consistently across all tests in a study.\n\n</div>\n\n\n### Simple Effects test\n\nThe significant interaction effect tells us that the effect of behavior differs by gender, or conversely, that gender differences vary across the three behavoirs.\n\nSimple effects analysis allows us to test the significance of these marginal effects.\n\nSimply put: They give us an overall test of the mean differences across levels of one factor, within each level of a different factor.\n\nConsult the table Univariate Tests (still for the contrast `/EMMEANS=TABLES(Behavior*Gender) COMPARE(Behavior) ADJ(LSD)`). This table displays the results of the simple effects tests.\n\nDoes the Behavior of waiters have an influence on the amount of tip money people give?\n\nWhat is the appropriate p-value? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.557\",\".557\"]'/>\n\nReport the simple effect test for waiters and interpret the finding, then check your answer.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n\nThere is no significant difference among the three behaviors within waiters. Hence, for waiters we don’t have evidence that the behavior has an effect on average tips received, F(2,52) = 0.591, p = .557.\n \n\n</div>\n\n\nAgain, consult the table Univariate Tests. This table gives the results of the simple effects tests.\n\nWhat p-value do we see here? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.001\",\".001\"]'/>\n\nTrue or false: the type of behavior of waitresses has an influence on the tip people give. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select>\n\n\nDoes it make sense to adjust your behavior as a waiter/waitress if you want to increase your tip?\n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_AJLCKKFRUE'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_AJLCKKFRUE\" value=\"\"></input> <span>For both waiters and waitresses behavior does affect amount of tip money received.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_AJLCKKFRUE\" value=\"\"></input> <span>For both waiters and waitresses behavior does not affect amount of tip money received.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_AJLCKKFRUE\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>For waitresses behavior does affect amount of tip money received, but for waiters it does not.</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_AJLCKKFRUE\" value=\"\"></input> <span>For waiters behavior does affect amount of tip money received, but for waitresses it does not.</span></label></div>\n \n\n\nReport your results, then check the answer.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\nWe do see a significant effect of behavior on average tip money for waitresses, F(2,52) = 46.385, p < .001. Hence, we have convincing evidence that the type of behavior by waitresses affects the average amount of tips. Results suggest that in order to have high tips, waitresses best can make small talk.\n \n\n</div>\n\n\n \n\n## Optional: do it yourself!\n\nOpen the datafile hiking.sav. The data file also contains data on weather.\n\nExamine the effect of weather and behavior and their potential interaction, with feelings as the dependent variable. \n\n\nWhat is the explained variance of the main effects and interaction effects together? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' data-tol='0.01' size='5' data-answer='[\"0.239\",\".239\"]'/>\n\nTrue or false: the explained variance of the whole model is significant. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select>\n\nTrue or false: the interaction effect is significant. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select>\n\nRequest a plot from SPSS that allows you to describe what the effects look like.\n\nDescribe the trends in your own words, then check your answer.\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n\nThe lines in the plot are not parallel, also pointing to an interaction effect.\n\n\n\n</div>\n \n\n\nPerform a simple effects analysis of the effect of behavior by weather.\n \nReport your findings and conclusion, then check your answer.\n\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Answer</button>\n\n\nWe see a significant effect of behavior when the weather was good, F(4,90) = 3.864, p = .006, while the effect of behavior is not significant when the weather was bad, F(4,90) = 1.320, p = .269.\n\nResults suggest that when the weather is good, joking and singing significantly improves the participants’ feelings about the guide.\n\nWhen the weather is bad, the behavior of the guide does not have much influence.\n\n\n</div>\n \n \n",
