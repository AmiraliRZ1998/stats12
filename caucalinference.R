## Basics of Causal Inference

### Slide 1: Introduction

- In statistics, we often study relationships between variables, but we need to be careful about interpreting these relationships as causal.
- Correlation and causality are related but distinct concepts.
- Causal inference aims to understand the cause-and-effect relationships between variables.

### Slide 2: Correlation vs. Causality

- Correlation: A statistical relationship between two variables. When they change, they tend to change together.
- Causality: A cause-and-effect relationship where changes in one variable directly influence changes in another variable.

### Slide 3: Confounding

- Confounding occurs when the relationship between two variables is distorted by the presence of a third variable.
- Confounding variables can create a false appearance of causality or hide a true causal relationship.
- Identifying and controlling for confounders is crucial in establishing causal relationships.

### Slide 4: Colliding

- Colliding, or selection bias, is another factor to consider in causal inference.
- Colliders are variables that are affected by two other variables, causing an apparent association between them.
- Ignoring colliders can lead to incorrect causal interpretations.

### Slide 5: Simpson's Paradox

- Simpson's paradox is a phenomenon where the direction of a relationship between two variables changes when a third variable is considered.
- It occurs when a lurking variable influences the association between the variables of interest.
- Simpson's paradox highlights the importance of examining subgroups and considering multiple variables in causal analysis.

### Slide 6: Causal Inference Process

1. Identify the research question and variables of interest.
2. Examine the existing literature to establish a theoretical basis for causality.
3. Design a study or experiment that can provide evidence of causality.
4. Control for confounders through study design or statistical methods.
5. Analyze the data using appropriate statistical techniques.
6. Interpret the results cautiously, considering potential limitations and alternative explanations.

### Slide 7: Conclusion

- Causal inference is a complex process that requires careful consideration of various factors.
- Correlation does not imply causation; it is essential to establish causality through rigorous research.
- Understanding confounding, colliding, and Simpson's paradox is crucial for accurate causal inference.
