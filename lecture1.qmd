# Introduction

## Why statistics?

You grew up in the "digital age". There is data about your entire life...

[Google Timeline](https://www.google.com/maps/timeline)

## And everybody wants your data

```{r}
#| out.width = "60%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/Everybodywantsyourdata.png", dpi = NA)
```

## What can you do with data?

* Data literacy is increasingly important in many jobs
* You can get insights from data to
    + Better understand social life
    + Predict sales and optimize marketing
    + Explore what activity in the brain is associated with observed behavior
* Data analysis is one of the most marketable concrete skills we teach at university

## Difference between Methods and Statistics

Methods is about the procedures of research:

* What actions do we take to collect good data
* Which participants to include
* How to measure what we want to measure
* How to design studies that are suitable for answering our research questions

## Difference between Methods and Statistics

Statistics is about analyzing data

* __Descriptive statistics__: describing/summarizing data 
* __Inferential statistics__: Making best guesses about the population from a smaller sample
* __Statistical modeling__: Representing a theory mathematically
* Predicting important outcomes (sales, well-being, neurological disorders)
* Exploring data to find interesting patterns
* Performing tests to answer theoretical research questions

# Dictionary of basic concepts

## Tabular data

Most data in the social sciences is tabular, where each row represents an individual $i$ observation, and each column $j$ represents that individual's data on several variables:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/assumptions19.png")
```

## About observations: Population

**Population:**

* The complete set of objects of interest
    + E.g., all people in NL, all students in this class
* Number of individuals in the population: N
    + N = 17.53 million, N = 75
 
## About observations: Sample

**Sample:**

* Observed part of the population
* Number of observations: *n*

## About variables: Construct

**Construct:**

*	Abstract feature of interest for the population
    + E.g., Short Term Memory, intelligence, perseverance, education

**Operational definition:**
    
* Concrete measurable representation of the construct
    + E.g., Number of words recalled, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS),
    ability to withstand a tasty treat, highest degree obtained

## About variables: Variable

**Variable:**

* (Mathematical) placeholder for specific values
* E.g., `WAIS` is a variable representing scores on the WAIS
* You can refer to a variable without (yet) knowing its specific values

*Data:*
	
* Specific values of a variable
* Example of data: Jen's score on the variable `WAIS` is 138


# Role of data in scientific research

## Empirical cycle

De Groot (1961)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/empirical cycle.png")
```


## Relationship between theory and empiricism

```{r}
#| eval = T
library(tidySEM)
lo <- get_layout("Construct A", "Construct B",
                 "Variable A", "Variable B", rows = 2)
edg <- data.frame(
  from = c("Construct A", "Variable A"),
  to = c("Construct B", "Variable B")
  )
p <- prepare_graph(layout = lo, edges = edg)
p$nodes$linetype <- c(2, 2, 1, 1)
p$nodes$fill <- c("gray90", "gray90", "white", "white")
p$edges$linetype <- c(2, 1)
plot(p)+geom_label(aes(x = c(3, 3), y = c(5, 3), label = c("Theoretical level", "Empirical level"), size = 20))
```

## Relationship between theory and empiricism

Theory:

Construct A influences construct B

* E.g., being exposed to war increases depression

Empirical test:

Variable A predicts variable B

* E.g., being deployed (yes/no) predicts scores on the SCL-90 depression questionnaire

## Sampling theory

```{r}
#| out.width = "90%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/sample_population.png")
```

## Samples: why?

* We want to make a claim about the population
* It is not possible to access the entire population
* We observe a part of the population: the *sample*
* Sample statistics are also our best guess about population parameters
    + Of course, sample statistics are not *equal to* population parameters
    + You will learn ways to express uncertainty about your best guess

## Samples: why?

* If the sample is *representative* of the population, your best guess will generalize better to the entire population and to new samples
* The best way to get a representative sample is *random sampling*    
* Random sample:
    +	Every population individual has the same probability of being included

## Non-random samples

* Probability of inclusion unknown to the researcher
* Examples: convenience sampling, snowball sampling, cluster sampling
* Sampling bias
    + E.g., Individuals that are easy to access ave higher probability of being included

# Measurement level

## NOIR measurement levels

Measurement level: What kind of information is contained in a variable?

Mnemonic: `n o i r` = black in French

Subsequent levels carry incremental information


## NOIR measurement levels

<small>

* Nominal
    + Categories; values differ in name only (e.g., majors)
* Ordinal
    + Categories; additionally, values have meaningful order (e.g., SES groups, bachelor year 1, 2, 3)
* Interval
    + Numeric; additionally, distance between values is meaningful
    + A step from 1 to 2 is equally large as a step from 2 to 3, or 5 to 6
* Ratio
    + Numeric; additionally has a meaningful zero-point
    + Because of this, ratios between two values are also meaningful

</small>

## Interval v Ratio

* Celsius and Fahrenheit are interval scales
* Kelvin is a ratio scale

```{r}
#| out.height = "400px"
knitr::include_graphics("images/Thermo1.png", dpi = NA)
```

## Interval v Ratio

```{r}
#| out.height = "400px"
knitr::include_graphics("images/Thermo2.png", dpi = NA)
```

## Measurement level matters

* Measurement level is a property of the construct and of the operational definition
    + Ideally, the measurement level of the construct and its variable are the same
    + E.g., sex assigned at birth: nominal
    + E.g., gender identification: ordinal or continuous
* Measurement level determines what statistics and analyses you can use

## Other common distinctions

* Categorical variables: Nominal, Ordinal
* Continuous variables: Interval, Ratio
* Qualitative variable: Difference in kind, Nominal
* Quantitative variables: Differences in degree; ordinal, interval, ratio

Edge cases: 

* Number of children (discrete ratio)
* Political orientation from liberal to conservative (ordinal, but which is higher/lower?)


# Descriptive statistics

## Descriptive Statistics {.smaller}

* Descriptive statistics summarize data across a sample
* You nearly always examine them to get a sense of your dataset
    + E.g., which major is most common among LAS students?
    + How old are my students, on average?
    + How much do the ages of my students vary?
    + What's the gender distribution?
* Descriptive statistics *may* also be relevant to answer research questions
    + E.g.: When evaluating exam questions: Is the proportion of correct answers on this MC question greater than chance?

## Distributions

| Type of variable | Central tendency | Graph |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Nominal | Frequency distribution | Bar chart |
| Ordinal | (Cumulative) frequency distribution | Bar chart |
| Interval/ratio | (Normal) probability distribution | Histogram, density plot |

## A nominal variable

```{r}
#| results = "asis"
tab <- sample(c("SS", "CN", "BE"), size = 75, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.6, .3, .1))
out <- data.frame(Major = names(table(tab)),
                  Frequency = as.vector(table(tab)),
                  Percent = as.vector(prop.table(table(tab))))
knitr::kable(out, row.names = FALSE, digits = 2)
```

## Bar chart

```{r}
#| results = "asis"
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(out, aes(x = Major, y = Frequency)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme_bw()
```

## An ordinal variable

```{r}
#| results = "asis"
tab <- sample(ordered(c("Low", "Medium", "High"), levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High")), size = 75, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.4, .5, .1))
out <- data.frame(SES = ordered(levels(tab), levels = levels(tab)),
                  Frequency = as.vector(table(tab)),
                  Percent = as.vector(prop.table(table(tab))),
                  Cumulative = as.vector(cumsum(prop.table(table(tab)))))
knitr::kable(out, row.names = FALSE, digits = 2)
```

## Bar chart

```{r}
#| results = "asis"
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(out, aes(x = SES, y = Frequency)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme_bw()
```

## A continuous variable

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(Height = rnorm(75, mean = sample(c(175, 165), 75, replace = T), sd = 5))
ggplot(dat, aes(x = Height)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, colour = "white") + theme_bw()
```

## Measures of central tendency

What is the average or most common response?

| Type of measure | Type of variable | Definition |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Mode | Nominal/Ordinal | Most common value |
| Median | Ordinal/Continuous | Middle value/50th percentile |
| Mean | Continuous | Average value |

## Measures of dispersion

How much variability is there in responses?

| Type of measure | Type of variable | Definition |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Frequency table | Nominal | Count/percentage of responses |
| Range | Ordinal/continuous | Minimum to maximum value |
| Variance | Continuous | Mean squared distance of observations to the mean |

## Median and Mode for ordinal variable

__Median:__  middle value

Example 1: \( _n_  = unequal\):  4\, 5\, 6\, 7\, 8\, 9\, 9 -> median is 7

Example 2: \( _n_  = equal\):  4\, 5\, 6\, 8\, 9\, 9 -> median 7 \(mean of the two middle values\)

__Mode:__  Most frequent score; 9 in both examples


## Mean, median, mode for continuous variable

# df <- data.frame(x <- rnorm(rep(c(-5, 0, 5), each = 5), rep(c(.5, 1), each = 5)),
#                  Distribution = paste0("M = ", rep(c(-5, 0, 5), each = 2000), ", SD = ", rep(c(.5, 1), each = 1000)))
# ggplot(df, aes(x = x, color = Distribution, fill = Distribution)) + geom_density(alpha = .2)
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x)) + 
  mapply(function(mean, sd, col) {
    stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean, sd = sd), col = col)
  }, 
  # enter means, standard deviations and colors here
  # mean = c(-5, 0, 5, -5, 0, 5), 
  # sd = c(1, 1, 1, .5, .5, .5), 
  # col = c('red', 'red', 'red', 'blue','blue','blue')
  mean = c(0, 0), 
  sd = c(1, .5), 
  col = c('red', 'blue')
) + theme_bw() + labs(x = "Value", y = "Probability")
```
