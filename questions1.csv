"What is the primary purpose of statistics?", "To summarize and analyze data", "To collect and store data", "To create data visualizations", "To design research studies", "Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for analyzing data.",
"What is the difference between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics?", "Descriptive statistics summarize data, while inferential statistics involves making informed guesses about parameters in a larger population.", "Descriptive statistics involves analyzing data, while inferential statistics involves collecting data.", "Descriptive statistics is used in social sciences, while inferential statistics is used in natural sciences.", "Descriptive statistics deals with nominal variables, while inferential statistics deals with ratio variables.", "Descriptive statistics are calculated based on sample data; inferential statistics involves using those sample statistics to make best guesses about population parameters and quantify uncertainty about those guesses.",
"What is the purpose of statistical modeling?", "To represent a theory as a testable statistical model.", "To predict outcomes and explore patterns in data", "To describe the characteristics of a dataset", "To make educated guesses about a larger population based on a smaller sample", "To summarize data using graphs and charts", "Statistical modeling in particular refers to the process of translating a theoretical model into a statistical model whose coefficients can be estimated using data.",
"What is the empirical cycle in scientific research?", "The process of formulating a theory, deriving hypotheses, testing these with data, and reflecting on theory", "The process of repeatedly collecting and analyzing data", "The process of designing research studies and selecting participants", "The process of summarizing and describing data using statistics", "The empirical cycle is a theoretical cyclical model of knowledge production through scientific research, whereby theory gives rise to hypotheses, which are tested in data, after which the theory is revisited based on the results.",
"What is the distinction between population and sample in statistics?", "Population refers to the complete set of potential participants, of which the sample is a subset.", "Population refers to all participants in a study, while sample refers all participants who provided complete answers.", "Population refers to inferential statistics, while sample refers to descriptive statistics.", "Population refers to the complete set of potential participants, of which the sample is a subset.",
"What is the variance?", "The average squared distance of observations to the mean.", "The average distance of observations to the mean.", "The measure of dispersion for scores on a continuous variable.", "The distance between the lowest and highest value on a continuous variable.", "The variance is the sum of squared distances of observations to the mean, divided by the number of observations minus one. So calculate:<br>$S_{X}^2= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n} = \frac{(7 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 8)}{5} = 7$",
"Six students work on a Statistics exam. They obtain the following grades: 8, 9, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The teacher calculates a measure of central tendency, which is equal to 7.5. Which statistic did the teacher calculate?", "Median","Mean", "Standard deviation", "Mode", "First rule out improbable answers;  the variance is not a measure of central tendency, and all grades are pretty close to each other, so it would be impossible for the variance to be that high. We can see what the mode (most common value) is: it's 8. So we only choose between mean or median. <br>Mean: calculate $\bar{X}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n} = \frac{8 + 9 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8}{6} = 7.17$<br>Median: order the numbers, note that there is an odd number, take the average of the two middle numbers. 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9 -> 7.5",
"For which of the three scatterplots below is the correlation coefficient strongest?", "A", "B", "C", "Correlation measures linear association, so eliminate option C. Option B shows a very small correlation - probably 0 or maybe .1. So the correct answer is A, which shows a moderate negative correlation."
