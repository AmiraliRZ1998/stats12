"An interaction effect is when...", "The effect of one predictor depends on the value of another predictor.", "The effect of two predictors is cumulative.", "The effect of one predictor is added to the effect of another predictor.", "You interact with your partipants.", "An interaction effect involves the combined influence of two or more predictor variables on the outcome variable, which is different from their individual effects.",
"What is the purpose of centering continuous predictors in interaction analysis?", "Centering continuous predictors helps in enhancing interpretability and reducing multicollinearity.", "Centering continuous predictors is necessary for regression analysis to provide correct results.", "Centering continuous predictors increases interpretability.", "Centering continuous predictors prevents multicollinearity.", "The two purposes of centering are to avoid artificial multicollinearity between the interacting variables and their product, and aids the model's interpretability.",
"When two continuous predictors interact, how many unique regression lines are generated?", "A theoretically infinite number of unique regression lines, as both predictors can take on an infinite number of values.", "Only one unique regression line is generated regardless of the interaction.", "Two unique regression lines are generated, one for each predictor.", "The number of unique regression lines depends on the number of unique values of the predictors.", "In interactions involving continuous predictors, the relationship between the predictors and the outcome variable can vary infinitely, leading to an infinite number of possible regression lines.",
"What is the concept of simple slopes in interaction analysis?", "Simple slopes refer to the effect of one predictor variable, evaluated at specific levels of another variable.", "Simple slopes are the slopes of predictors before they are centered.", "Simple slopes are the partial effects of two predictors, controlling for their interaction effect.", "Simple slopes refer to the linear effects of a predictor on the outcome variable.", "Simple slopes allow us to assess how the relationship between two predictors changes at different levels of the moderator variable, helping to understand conditional effects.",
"In a multiple regression model with two continuous predictors, how would you assess the effect of one predictor at different levels of the other predictor?", "By centering one predictor at a specific level and re-computing the interaction term.", "By excluding the interaction term from the model.", "By computing the mean of both predictors.", "By standardizing the predictors.", "Centering and re-computing the interaction term allows us to obtain the slopes of the predictor of interest at different levels of the moderator, helping us understand its conditional effects.",
"What does it mean when an interaction term in a regression model is not significant?", "When an interaction term is not significant, it suggests that the effect of one predictor variable on the outcome variable is consistent across all levels of the other predictor variable.", "An insignificant interaction term indicates a problem with the data collection process.", "An insignificant interaction term indicates that the model is overfitting.", "An insignificant interaction term means that the outcome variable is not related to the predictor variables.", "When an interaction term is not significant, it implies that the relationship between the predictors and the outcome remains relatively constant regardless of the values of the interacting predictors.",
"What is the predicted value for an individual with a score of 2.5 on X1 and score of 35 on X2, given the following regression equation: Y = 10 + 2 * X1 - 0.5 * X2 + 0.1 * (X1 * X2)?","6.25", "-2.4","-3.75","8.75", "Plug in the values: Y = 10 + 2 * 2.5 - 0.5 * 35 + 0.1 * (2.5 * 35)",
"What is the effect of a one-unit increase in X1 on the predicted value for an individual who scores 40 on X2, given the following regression equation: Y = 8 + 1.2 * X1 - 0.3 * X2 + 0.05 * (X1 * X2)?","3.2","1.2","0.1", "1.5", "You have to add the interaction term to the effect of X1; when X2 has the value 0, the effect of X1 is 1.2. When X2 has the value 40, add 0.05*40 to that effect.",
"Assume that when X1 and X2 are centered around the mean, we obtain the following regression equation: Y = 6 + 1.5 * X1 - 0.4 * X2 + 0.08 * (X1 * X2). What is the simple slope of X1 on Y when we add 1SD to X2, and an SD is 0.5?","1.46","1.54", "1.58","1.5","Calculating the simple slope works just the same as calculating the effect of X1 for different values of X2; what's important to realize is that adding +1SD means putting people who scores -1SD at zero, so you should calculate the effect for -1 SD."
