We can also use regression analysis to examine mean differences between the categories of a nominal or ordinal predictor with more than two categories.
Suppose we have a categorical predictor, such as socioeconomic status (SES), with three categories: Low, Medium, and High. We want to predict fathers' involvement in child rearing based on these SES categories. We can use regression analysis to model this relationship by using dummy variables.

We previously discussed how *bivariate* linear regression allows us to model the effect of a binary categorical predictor by using dummy coding.
We code one variable as the reference group (giving it the value 0), 
and estimate the mean difference between the reference group and the other category.

When we have two or more categories, we can use the same principle - but we need to expand the model. For our example with SES, we can select one reference category (say, High SES), and we would create **two** dummy variables to estimate the mean differences between the reference category and the Medium and Low SES categories.
Our regression model then includes both dummy variables as predictors, along with the intercept term.

This regression model is completely equivalent to one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). Think of ANOVA as a different interface to the same analysis, which presents the results in a slightly different way that is more common in some subfields of social science.

When we perform an ANOVA, we conduct an omnibus test of differences between group means.
The default null hypothesis is that all group means are equal, and the alternative hypothesis suggests that at least two group means differ.
We test this hypothesis with an F-test for the overall significance of the model.
You are already familiar with this test from the lecture on sums of square.

One way to think about the F-test in th context of ANOVA is that it compares the size of the variance (differences) in group means, relative to the error variance in the data.
If the differences between group means are large relative to the spread of the data, we observe a significant test.
In ANOVA, the regression sum of squares is also called the "between-group sum of squares",
and the error sum of squares is also called "within-group sum of squares".

When interpreting the results of ANOVA,
it's common to use eta squared $\eta^2$ as an effect size.
It is simply another name for the familiar $R^2$.
It reflects the proportion of variance in the outcome variable that can be explained by the categorical predictor.

# Formative Test

A formative test helps you assess your progress in the course, and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material. If you get a question wrong, you will receive a hint on how to improve your understanding of the material.

Complete the formative test ideally after youâ€™ve seen the lecture, but before the lecture meeting in which we can discuss any topics that need more attention

**Question 1**

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
mc("Suppose that I ask a random sample of 5 students how many pairs of shoes they have. The number of pairs are: 7, 6, 8, 6, and 8. What is the variance of these pairs of shoes?", 1, 4, 7, 2)
```

**Question 2**

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
mc("Six students work on a Statistics exam. They obtain the following grades: 8, 9, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The teacher calculates a certain statistic, which is equal to 7.5. Which statistic did the teacher calculate?", "Median","Mean", "Standard deviation", "Mode")
```

**Question 3**

For which of the three scatterplots below is the correlation coefficient largest? `r mcq(c(answer = "A", "B", "C"))`

**Question 1**

The variance is the sum of squared distances of observations to the mean, divided by the number of observations minus one. So calculate:

$S_{X}^2= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n} = \frac{(7 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 8)}{5} = 7$

**Question 2**

First rule out improbable answers; all grades are pretty close to each other, so it's impossible for the variance to be that high. We can see what the mode (most common value) is: it's 8. So we only choose between mean or median.

Mean: calculate $\bar{X}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n} = \frac{8 + 9 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8}{6} = 7.17$

Median: order the numbers, note that there is an odd number, take the average of the two middle numbers. 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9 -> 7.5

**Question 3**

Correlation measures linear association, so eliminate option C. Option B shows a very small correlation - probably 0 or maybe .1. So the correct answer is A, which shows a moderate negative correlation.
