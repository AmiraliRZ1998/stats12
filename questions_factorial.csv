"What is the primary objective of factorial ANOVA?","To examine the effects of multiple categorical predictors and their interactions on a continuous outcome variable.","To compare the means of two independent groups.","To analyze the variance between different levels of a single categorical predictor.","To determine the correlation between two continuous variables.","Factorial ANOVA allows us to explore how multiple categorical predictors and their interactions impact a continuous outcome variable.",
"In a 2x2 factorial design, how many unique conditions or groups are there?","4","2","3","6","In a 2x2 factorial design, there are 2 levels for Factor A and 2 levels for Factor B, resulting in a total of 2 x 2 = 4 unique conditions.",
"What does a main effect represent in factorial ANOVA?","The influence of a single factor on the dependent variable, controlling for other factors.","The interaction between two factors on the dependent variable.","The combined effect of all factors on the dependent variable.","The unexplained variance in the model.","A main effect reflects the impact of a specific factor on the dependent variable while considering the influence of other factors.",
"What does an interaction effect capture in factorial ANOVA?","How the effects of one factor depend on the levels of another factor.","The combined effect of all factors on the dependent variable.","The influence of a single factor on the dependent variable, controlling for other factors.","The unexplained variance in the model.","An interaction effect in factorial ANOVA describes how the effects of one factor change based on the levels of another factor.",
"Which effect size measure quantifies the proportion of variance explained by each factor or interaction relative to the total variance?","Eta squared","Eta","Partial eta squared","Sum of Squares","Eta squared is an effect size measure in factorial ANOVA that indicates the proportion of variance explained by a factor or interaction relative to the total variance.",
"What does it mean when lines representing different conditions on a means plot cross each other?","There is a significant interaction between the factors.","The main effects of the factors are significant.","The factors have equal effects on the dependent variable.","The model is poorly specified.","Crossing lines on a means plot indicate a significant interaction between the factors, suggesting that the effect of one factor depends on the levels of another factor.",
"In a 3x2 factorial design, how many dummies would be required in total to represent both factors?","4","3","6","5","For a 3x2 factorial design, Factor A would require 2 dummies, and Factor B would require 1 dummy. Therefore, the total number of dummies needed is 2 + 1 = 3.",
"Which term describes the variance remaining unexplained by the factors and interactions in factorial ANOVA?","Residual variance","Explained variance","Total variance","Interaction variance","Residual variance refers to the unexplained variability in the dependent variable after accounting for the effects of factors and interactions in factorial ANOVA.",
"What does a partial eta squared measure in factorial ANOVA?","The proportion of variance explained by each factor, controlling for other factors.","The total variance explained by each factor.","The proportion of variance explained by each factor relative to the unexplained variance.","The interaction between two factors.","Partial eta squared quantifies the proportion of variance explained by a specific factor while controlling for the influence of other factors in the model."
