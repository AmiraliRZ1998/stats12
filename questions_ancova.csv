"What is a valid reason for using covariates in ANCOVA?","To increase statistical power","To increase the total variance", "To create more complex models","To replace categorical predictors","Covariates can be used in ANCOVA to reduce error variance caused by factors other than the predictor of interest.",
"What is an example of a 'good control' variable in ANCOVA?","A confounder","A variable unrelated to the predictor","A variable affected by the outcome","A variable related to the predictor","A confounder is a 'good control' variable in ANCOVA â€“ a variable that influences both the predictor of interest and the outcome.",
"Which of the following is an example of a 'bad control' variable in ANCOVA?","A variable affected by the outcome","A variable unrelated to the predictor or outcome","A variable that causes the predictor","A confounder","A variable that is affected by the outcome is a 'bad control' variable in ANCOVA and can introduce biases.",
"In a randomized controlled experiment, are there benefits to controling for any observed differences between the two experimental groups?","No, random assignment breaks the predictor's relationships with confounders","Yes, controlling for relevant covariates is essential","Only if the covariates are significantly related to the outcome","Only if the covariates are significantly related to the predictor", "In a randomized controlled experiment, random assignment breaks the relationships between confounders and the treatment. Therefore, controlling for covariates related to the predictor is unnecessary.",
"What is the purpose of calculating adjusted means in ANCOVA?","To account for covariate effects","To create new variables","To replace the original means","To improve the model's fit","Adjusted means in ANCOVA are controlled for the effects of covariates, allowing us to understand how groups would differ on the outcome variable if they had equal scores on the covariate.",
"Which of the following is a key factor in choosing appropriate covariates for ANCOVA?","Causal relationships","Number of covariates","Covariates with the highest correlations","Covariates with the smallest p-values","Causal relationships are crucial when selecting covariates for ANCOVA. It's important to choose covariates that are related to the outcome and predictor in a meaningful way.",
"What is the distinguishing feature of ANCOVA relative to multiple regression?","ANCOVA always includes a categorical predictor and control variable(s)","ANCOVA controls for confounding variables","Multiple regression includes only covariates","Multiple regression includes only continuous predictors","ANCOVA is one example of the broader category of models known as multiple regression; it is characterized by having a categorical predictor of interest and (continuous) covariates.",
"In which of these situations should you avoid controlling a particular covariate in ANCOVA?","When the covariate is a mediator","When the covariate is a confounder","When the covariate is irrelevant","When the covariate is perfectly correlated with another covariate","Avoid controlling for covariates that are mediators, as controlling for mediators could lead to overcontrol bias and distort the relationships between the predictor and outcome.",
"An ANCOVA model compares statistics grades for two classes of students, controlling for number of hours studied per week. The regression model is $\text{Grade} = -1.27 + 0.50*D_{class2} + .30*Hours$. The unadjusted mean grades are 5.2 for class 1 and 7.3 for class 2. The mean hours studied were 21.56 for class 1 and 30.23 for class 2. The overall mean hours studied was 25.90. What are the adjusted means?", "6.50 and 6.00", "9.35 and 2.97", "-1.27 and -1.77", "Use the formula $\bar{Y}_g^{adj} = \bar{Y}_g - b(\bar{X}_g-\bar{X})$"
