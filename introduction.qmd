Statistics are more relevant than ever in this digital age, where data about our entire lives is readily available, and software to analyze such data has become extremely user-friendly and freely available. We live in a world where everyone wants our data, and being data literate is becoming increasingly important across industries.

Statistics allows us to make sense of data and gain valuable insights. It helps us better understand social phenomena, predict sales and optimize marketing strategies, and even explore the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Data analysis is one of the most marketable skills taught at universities.

Before we delve deeper into statistics, it's crucial to distinguish between methods and statistics. Methods refer to the procedures used in research, such as data collection, participant selection, and study design. On the other hand, statistics focuses on analyzing the data obtained from these methods.

Two fundamental branches of statistics covered in this course are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing the characteristics of a dataset, while inferential statistics allows us to make educated guesses about a larger population based on a smaller sample.

Statistical modeling is another aspect of statistics where theories are represented mathematically. This enables us to predict important outcomes, such as sales figures, well-being, or the likelihood of neurological disorders. Statistical modeling also allows us to explore data for interesting patterns or to perform tests to answer theoretically driven research questions.

In scientific research, statistics can help us test theories. The process of scientific knowledge acquisition is described by the empirical cycle: We start with a theory, from which we derive testable hypotheses. A theory is an abstract system of assumptions about the relationships between constructs. A hypothesis is a concrete statement, derived from the theory, about expected quantitative relationships between measured variables. We then collect data and test the hypothesis. If the hypothesis is refuted, we re-examine the theory and possibly ammend it. 

To lay a foundation for understanding statistics, it's essential to be familiar with some basic concepts. First, data in the social sciences often comes in tabular format (e.g., spreadsheets), where each row represents an individual observation, and each column represents the individuals' scores on various variables.

A crucial distinction is the one between population and sample. The population refers to the complete set of objects of interest, such as all people in a country or all students in a class. However, due to practical limitations, we usually do not have access to the population. Instead, we draw a sample from it, which is a subset of the population. Sampling theory establishes the rationale for drawing inferences about a population based on samples. Sample statistics serve as our best estimate of population parameters. If the sample is representative, those estimates will be unbiased. Moreover, we can estimate our uncertainty about the sample statistics as estimates of population parameters. The best way to ensure a representative sample is to use random sampling, where each individual in the population has an equal chance of being included.

The distinction between constructs and variables is also important. Constructs are abstract features of interest within a population, like short-term memory, intelligence, or education. Variables, on the other hand, are mathematical placeholders that represent specific values associated with these constructs. Data, then, refers to the specific values of a variable.

Measurement level refers to the kind of information contained in a variable. The four common measurement levels are nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Nominal variables have categories that differ in name only, while ordinal variables have categories with a meaningful order. Interval variables have meaningful intervals between values, which allows for meaningful comparisons between values. Finally, ratio variables have a meaningful zero-point, which additionally allows for the computation of meaningful ratios between values.

Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and analyze data. They help us get a sense of the dataset and answer questions like the most common major among students or the average age of a group. Descriptive statistics can also be relevant in answering research questions, such as evaluating exam questions or determining if the proportion of correct answers on a multiple-choice question is greater than chance.

In summary, statistics is a powerful tool for analyzing and interpreting data. It helps us gain insights into various aspects of social life, make predictions, and test theories. By understanding fundamental concepts, such as measurement levels and descriptive statistics, we can start exploring and making sense of data in a meaningful way.

# Formative Test

A formative test helps you assess your progress in the course, and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material. If you get a question wrong, you will receive a hint on how to improve your understanding of the material.

Complete the formative test ideally after youâ€™ve seen the lecture, but before the lecture meeting in which we can discuss any topics that need more attention

**Question 1**

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
mc("Suppose that I ask a random sample of 5 students how many pairs of shoes they have. The number of pairs are: 7, 6, 8, 6, and 8. What is the variance of these pairs of shoes?", 1, 4, 7, 2)
```

**Question 2**

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
mc("Six students work on a Statistics exam. They obtain the following grades: 8, 9, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The teacher calculates a certain statistic, which is equal to 7.5. Which statistic did the teacher calculate?", "Median","Mean", "Standard deviation", "Mode")
```

**Question 3**

For which of the three scatterplots below is the correlation coefficient largest? `r mcq(c(answer = "A", "B", "C"))`

**Question 1**

The variance is the sum of squared distances of observations to the mean, divided by the number of observations minus one. So calculate:

$S_{X}^2= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n} = \frac{(7 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 8)}{5} = 7$

**Question 2**

First rule out improbable answers; all grades are pretty close to each other, so it's impossible for the variance to be that high. We can see what the mode (most common value) is: it's 8. So we only choose between mean or median.

Mean: calculate $\bar{X}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n} = \frac{8 + 9 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8}{6} = 7.17$

Median: order the numbers, note that there is an odd number, take the average of the two middle numbers. 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9 -> 7.5

**Question 3**

Correlation measures linear association, so eliminate option C. Option B shows a very small correlation - probably 0 or maybe .1. So the correct answer is A, which shows a moderate negative correlation.
