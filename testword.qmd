# Overview {.unnumbered}

This course covers the basics of statistics and data analysis.
The ability to extract insights from data is an essential skill for both academic and non-academic work, and "data literacy" is increasingly important in a world where data are collected about every aspect of our lives.
After completing this course, you will be able to independently analyze data,
interpret and report your findings,
and assess the results of analyses performed by others, such as you might find in scientific articles.

This GitBook contains all relevant information about this course.
It is assumed that every student reads it carefully.
If you have any questions, first consult this GitBook,
then ask a fellow student, and only if your question is still not answered,
then contact the course coordinator.

Communication about the course occurs through [Canvas](https://tilburguniversity.instructure.com/courses/12004) (Login with your student ID and password).

## Learning goals

<span id="learninggoals">
After taking this course, students will be able to...

### All majors

1.	compute and interpret commonly used descriptive statistics such as the sample mean, the median, the mode, variance and standard deviation, the standard error, and the correlation coefficient.
2.	recognize different probability distributions such as the normal distribution, and make computations for these probability distributions. 
3.	explain the essential aspects of null-hypothesis significance testing, including sampling distributions, Type I and Type II errors, one-tailed versus two-tailed testing, and statistical power. 
4.	apply different statistical tests such as the Z-test, the one sample t-test, the one way Between Subjects Analysis of Variance test, and statistical tests related to (multiple) linear regression analysis with continuous and categorical predictors; and clarify the statistical and/or methodological assumptions that apply to the techniques that are discussed in this course.

## Software {#sec-software}

During lab sessions, you work on the exercises and your portfolio using the commercial SPSS software installed on university computers.

If you want to use your own computer instead, you might consider trying some free alternatives to SPSS:

* PSPP, which is designed to be nearly identical to SPSS with all the same basic functionality: <https://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/pspp.html>
* JASP, which is more modern, looks nicer and is very easy to use – but looks less similar to SPSS: 
<https://jasp-stats.org/>


## Attendance

Attendance is mandatory based on our experience that students who actively participate tend to pass the course, whereas those who do not tend to drop out or fail.
All lectures and practicals ‘build’ on each other,
so if you have to miss either one, absolutely make sure you have caught up with the materials before the next session.

## Study Load

Below is a breakdown of the expected study load:

<!-- ## Teaching Philosophy -->

<!-- The corona crisis is challenging all of us to rethink how we teach and learn. But aside from the challenges, it also offers opportunities. In adapting this course, we kept two goals in mind: increasing the alignment between the way of teaching and the learning goals, and ensuring high-quality interaction among students and between the students and teachers while still using online communication. Based on these goals, we made the following changes: -->

<!-- 1. During the course, you will be working in learning teams to promote interaction among students and peer support -->
<!-- 2. The two in-person exams (4 hours each) are replaced with take-home assignments: Two group assignments, and one individual assignment. -->


### Why group assignments?

Contact with fellow students is a key aspect of the university experience.
We want to stimulate you to engage with the material and with one another.
Therefore, the portfolio assignments are made in groups.
There are also aspects of learning in groups that can really improve your knowledge, like peer feedback.
To ensure that every group member pulls their weight, the final exam tests each student's individual comprehension of all material covered in the portfolios.

Groups comprise 3-5 members and are assigned randomly when the course starts.
However, it is allowed to switch with a consenting member of another group,
or to join/merge with another small group if your group has become smaller than 3 members.
There are three portfolio registration deadlines. At this point, one group member submits the definitive group composition via a Google form.

### Why use portfolio assessment?

Portfolio assignments are well-suited for a skills-based course like Statistics 1 & 2.
They also take a lot of the pressure off because you can work at your own pace, and keep improving the work until it is good enough. We entrust you with the responsibility of making  these portfolio assignments in good faith, without instrumental assistance from outside your group or plagiarism, so I kindly ask you to make good on this trust, and hand in original work to show what you’ve learned.

## Grading

<span id="grading">
Your grade is based on three portfolio assignments made in groups,
and one individual exam to test comprehension of the material covered in the portfolios.

A grade of 5.5 or higher is required for each component to pass the course.

### Portfolios 40% (3 x 13.3%)

You work on the portfolio assignments with your group, both during the lab sessions and outside of class.
For each assignment, register your group membership before the set deadline at <http://tiny.cc/stats12_portfolio>.
You hand in your group’s portfolio assignment before the set deadline, at which point it is graded. If your grade is below the passing level of 5.5, your group will have the opportunity to revise the portfolio based on teacher feedback to receive a maximum grade of 6.

Groups should equally distribute the work load for the portfolio assignments. In case doubts are raised about the equal distribution of labor in a particular group, the portfolio assignment in question will be supplemented with individual oral examination and an individual grade, which can not exceed the original grade for the group assignment. In other words, failing to distribute the work properly can not have positive effects, but it can have negative effects on your grade. To prevent this, make clear agreements about the distribution of work with your group mates.

### Exam 60% 

To make sure that all students are equally involved in the making of the portfolio assignments, an individual exam assesses comprehension of the material covered therein. It is a digital multiple choice exam. Note that some of the questions are developed by you, the students (see portfolio)! You thus have an advantage if you develop questions that are good enough to be on the exam.

You may bring all course materials to the exam, including the portfolio. The exam consists of a common part and a major-specific part. Note: As per university policy, a guessing correction is applied to your grade.

**Note: I recommend that you download the GitBook onto a USB stick so you have access during your exam!**

## Assignments 

Below is a description of the assignments.
For each assignment, every element labeled with a lower case letter is graded fail (0 points), pass (1 point), or excellent (1.5 points).
Grades are summed for each assignment, and rescaled from 1-10.
The final grade is the average across assignments of the rescaled grades.
Note the stated word limit for each section.
If you can write a good report with fewer words, that's fine.
If you exceed the word limit however,
your grade for that section cannot exceed a pass (1 point).

The focus of the assignments should me on motivating, reporting, interpreting, and discussing your analyses.
You will get a good grade for well-reasoned and discussed analyses.

See the Appendices section to access data sources for the assignment.

## Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) 

Be warned: LLMs learn from all text on the internet, which includes a *lot* of incorrect information about statistics. As a result, my experience is that e.g. ChatGPT produces a lot of incorrect output for statistics assignments.

If you decide to use LLMs, it is your responsibility to thoroughly check its output for logical consistency and correctness. You may not yet have the level of expertise required to know when ChatGPT generates irrelevant nonsense - but the teacher who grades your work does. Consider this carefully when deciding what makes more sense: doing your work manually, making sure each step is correct - or outsourcing it to AI, and then checking its work before submitting.
