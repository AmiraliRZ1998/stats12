"What does reliability refer to in psychometrics?","Consistency or stability of test scores over time or across measurement occasions.","The extent to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure.","The clarity and readability of questionnaire items.","The average covariance between items and the average variance of items.","Reliability refers to the consistency or stability of test scores over time or across different measurement occasions.",
"Which type of reliability assesses consistency across repeated administrations of the same test?","Test-retest reliability","Internal consistency","Inter-rater reliability","Content reliability","Test-retest reliability assesses consistency across repeated administrations of the same test over time.",
"What is the primary purpose of content validity?","To ensure that the instrument adequately covers all aspects of the construct being measured.","To assess whether items in the instrument are clearly related to the construct of interest.","To determine the association between the instrument and external measures.","To examine the correlation between individual items and the total scale score.","Content validity involves ensuring that the instrument comprehensively covers all aspects of the construct being measured.",
"Which type of validity assesses whether an instrument is associated with relevant outcomes or indicators of the construct?","Criterion validity","Face validity","Content validity","External consistency","Criterion validity assesses whether an instrument is associated with outcomes or indicators of the construct it is designed to measure.",
"What is the key focus of face validity?","The apparent relevance and clarity of the instrument's items.","The relationship between items within a test.","The association between repeated assessments of the test.","The stability of test scores over time.","Face validity focuses on the apparent relevance and clarity of the instrument's items.",
"Which measure of internal consistency is based on the average covariance between items and the average variance of items?","Cronbach's alpha","Test-retest correlation","McDonald's Omega","Variance","Cronbach's alpha estimates the internal consistency of a scale by considering the average covariance between items and the average variance of items.",
"What is the relationship between reliability and validity?","Reliability is a necessary condition for validity.","Validity is a necessary condition for reliability.","You can't have reliability without validity, and vice versa.","Reliability and validity are independent.","Reliability is a necessary condition for validity, meaning that an instrument must be consistent and stable to accurately measure the intended construct.",
"If an item is contra-indicative, which statement is likely true about the item-total correlation for that item?", "It is negative", "It is positive", "It is near-zero", "It is small (e.g., below .30)", "Contra-indicative items measure the opposite of what the scale measures, so they should correlate negatively with the scale.",
"What is true about alpha-if-item-deleted?", "It is a diagnostic tool that can help you identify items that don't work well with the rest of a questionnaire.", "It is a diagnostic tool that can help you identify unreliable items.", "It is a decision criterion to eliminate items from a questionnaire.", "It is a diagnostic tool to help you identify items that are not valid.", "Alpha-if-item-deleted tells you what Cronbach's alpha of a questionnaire would be if you left out that item. You should not follow this blindly, but you can use it to identify items that don't work well with the rest of the scale. This says nothing about the reliability of individual items, nor their validity."
