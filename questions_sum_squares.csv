"What does SSE stand for in linear regression?", "Sum of Squared Errors", "Sum of Standard Errors", "Sum of Squared Explained Variance", "Sum of Squares for the Expectation", "SSE stands for Sum of Squared Errors, which represents the sum of the squared differences between actual and predicted values.",
"Which of the following describes the concept of Ordinary Least Squares?", "Minimizing the sum of squared errors", "Minimizing the total sum of squares", "Minimizing the regression sum of squares", "Minimizing the correlation", "Ordinary Least Squares aims to minimize the total prediction error, which is achieved by finding the regression line.",
"What does the Regression Sum of Squares (RSS) represent?", "The reduction in sum of squares by using the regression line as a predictor, rather than the mean", "The sum of squared prediction errors", "The total sum of squares minus the predicted values", "The explained variance by the regression line", "RSS is the reduction in sum of squares that occurs when using the regression line to predict observations instead of just the mean.",
"What is the purpose of the Total Sum of Squares (TSS) in linear regression?", "It measures the total variability of the dependent variable.", "It measures the explained variance of the predictor.", "It measures the residual error in the model.", "It measures the standard deviation of the errors.", "TSS measures the total variability of the dependent variable around its mean.",
