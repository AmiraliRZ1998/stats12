<h1>Lab 1: Introduction</h1>
<section id="interaction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interaction">Interaction</h2>
<p>In this assignment we work with the PublicParticipation.sav data. It contains (fictional) data on the following variables: income (higher scores, more income), public participation, education, age, and gender (0 = females; 1 = males). Public participation involves being member of school boards, municipal councillor, etc.</p>
<p>In this assignment we will see how we can model interaction between a continuous predictor and a dichotomous predictor.</p>
<p>Suppose we are interested in relationship between age and public participation, and we want to know if the relationship is moderated by gender. An interaction model is conceptually represented as follows (these two diagrams are interchangeable):</p>

<p><img src="images/y_on_x1x2int1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Modeling Interactions</p>
<p>The regression model for testing the interaction is:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Y' = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}D_{g} + b_{3}XD_{g}\)</span></p>
<p>where X = age, and D_g = gender (0 = women; 1 = men). Notice that women are our reference group.</p>
<p>To model interaction we need to create a new variable, which is the product of the dummy variable (gender in our case) and (age in our case).</p>
<p>This is best done via syntax, but to use the graphical interface proceed as follows:</p>
<p>via Transform &gt; compute variable</p>
<p>Give the new variable a name (i.e., the target variable), say GenderTAge.</p>
<p>Then specify the product at the right (see more information button). Click on Paste, select and run the code. Check in Data View whether the product term was added correctly.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the syntax is:</p>
<pre><code>COMPUTE GenderTAge = Gender * Age.
EXECUTE.</code></pre>
<p>Now run the regression analysis that includes the interaction effect.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Just like with dummies you must include all dummies that belong to the same variable in the model together, with an interaction term, you must always include its constituent variables as well. This is because the interaction term only <em>modifies</em> the effect of its constituent variables; the effect of those constituent variables must thus also be in the model.</p>
<p>So, if you add variable intXTZ into the model, you must also include X and Z.</p>
<p>Via analyze &gt; regression &gt; linear; choose age, gender and GenderTAge as the independent variables, and public participation as the dependent variable.</p>
<p>Consult the table Regression coefficients. Write down the general estimated model.</p>
<p>Finish the following equation, then check your answer.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{Public Participation' = .....}\)</span></p>
<div class="webex-solution">

Answer
</button>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{Public Participation}′ = 3.252 + 0.137*\text{Age} + 12.439*\text{Gender} − 0.116*\text{Gender}*\text{Age}\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Now write down the estimated models down for women and men separately. Hint: fill in 0 and 1 in the general estimated model mentioned in the previous step, then simplify the formula.</p>
<p>Complete the equations for women (W) and men (M):</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{PP}_W'=\)</span> <input class="webex-solveme nospaces" data-tol="0.01" size="5" data-answer="[&quot;3.252&quot;]"> <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> <input class="webex-solveme nospaces" data-tol="0.01" size="5" data-answer="[&quot;0.137&quot;,&quot;.137&quot;]"> <span class="math inline">\(*\text{Age}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\text{PP}_M'=\)</span> <input class="webex-solveme nospaces" data-tol="0.01" size="6" data-answer="[&quot;15.691&quot;]"> <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> <input class="webex-solveme nospaces" data-tol="0.01" size="5" data-answer="[&quot;0.021&quot;,&quot;.021&quot;]"> <span class="math inline">\(*\text{Age}\)</span></p>
<p>Now draw (on a piece of paper) a graph of the results. That is, put age on the x-axis, the predicted public participation on the y-axis, and draw separate regression lines for males and females.</p>
<p>True or false</p>
<p>In the sample, age has a positive effect on public participation for women but a negative effect for men? <select class="webex-select"><option value="blank"></option><option value="">TRUE</option><option value="answer">FALSE</option></select></p>
<p>The researchers tested at the 5% level and concluded:</p>
<p>“We have convincing evidence that the population effect of age on public participation is different for men and women.” <select class="webex-select"><option value="blank"></option><option value="">TRUE</option><option value="answer">FALSE</option></select></p>
<p>The estimated regression model was:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Y'= 3.252 + 0.137Age + 12.439D_g - 0.116(Age \times D_g)\)</span></p>
<p>What would the regression equation look like if we would have used the men as the reference group? Use logic to answer this question, instead of re-running the analysis.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Y'=\)</span> <input class="webex-solveme nospaces" data-tol="0.01" size="6" data-answer="[&quot;15.691&quot;]"> <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> <input class="webex-solveme nospaces" data-tol="0.01" size="5" data-answer="[&quot;0.021&quot;,&quot;.021&quot;]"> <span class="math inline">\(*\text{Age}+\)</span> <input class="webex-solveme nospaces" data-tol="0.01" size="7" data-answer="[&quot;-12.439&quot;]"> <span class="math inline">\(*D_g+\)</span> <input class="webex-solveme nospaces" data-tol="0.01" size="5" data-answer="[&quot;0.116&quot;,&quot;.116&quot;]"> <span class="math inline">\(*(\text{Age} \times D_g)\)</span></p>
<!-- LaTeX: ŷ = 15.691 + .021Age - 12.439D_{g}  + .116AgeD_{g}  -->
<p>To verify our answer to the previous question, we will recode the variable Gender such that males are scored 0 (= reference group) and females are scored 1.</p>
<p>Proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>via Transform &gt; Recode into different variables</p></li>
<li><p>Select Gender.</p></li>
<li><p>Give a name to the new output variable (say GenderFem), give a label (say: “Gender (ref=males)” click on change.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify old and new values: old value 0 becomes 1 and old value 1 becomes 0 (don’t forget to click on add in between).</p></li>
<li><p>Click OK. Verify that SPSS added a new column with a dummy variable where males are the reference group.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the product variable for the interaction between age and gender but now use the dummy having males as reference group.</p></li>
<li><p>Rerun the regression analysis, but now using the new gender variable and interaction term. If you’re answer in the previous step is correct you should find the values back in the table Regression Coefficients.</p></li>

<p>Use syntax to create the dummies.</p>
<p>We are now ready for the regression analysis.</p>
<p>Run a hierarchical regression analysis with public participation as dependent variable. Model 1 only includes age. Model 2 includes age and the dummies. So we have the following nested models:</p>
<p>This model does not include the interaction effects yet! This means that we assume that the regression lines are parallel to one another. In the next assignment we check whether this assumption is reasonable.</p>

<li>Select public participation as the dependent variable and only age as the independent variable. Click on next.</li>
<li>Now select the two dummies we have created in the previous step. The two dummies together represent education. Always enter dummies into the model together!</li>
<li>Via Statistics ask for the R-change statistics.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interaction-with-more-than-two-categories">Interaction with more than Two Categories</h2>
<p>In the previous assignment, we assumed that the effect of Age on Public participation was equal for each of the education level groups. However, we do not know whether this assumption is reasonable. In this assignment, we will check whether the interaction effect between Age and Education level is statistically significant or not.</p>
<p>Create the two interaction terms using syntax, with the Compute variable command. Note that we need two interaction terms: D1Tage and D2Tage.</p>
<p>We are now ready for the regression analysis.</p>

<p>The best thing to do now is to interpret the model without the interaction effect. This is the smaller Model1.</p>
<p>What can we conclude about the effect of Age and Education level if we interpret Model 1?</p>
<p>General answer comments Age and Education level jointly explain 9.7% of the total variance in Public Participation.​ However, not any effect of the predictors is significant (using α=.05).</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to Transform &gt; Compute Variable</li>
<li>Give a name to the new product variable in Target Variable (GenderTRelco for example).</li>
<li>In Nummeric Expression you need to specify how the new variable should be computed. You have to enter gender * sccowork to compute the product of gender and sccowork.</li>
<li>Paste and run the syntax, and check whether the product variable was added</li>

Question1 ptsEdit this question Delete this question Conduct a multiple regression analysis (using Analyze &gt; Regression &gt; Linear) with scemoti as dependent variable. The independent variables are the main effects (gender and sccowork) and the interaction effect (GenderTRelco).</p>
<p>What is the p-value of the interaction effect?</p>

Question1 ptsEdit this question Delete this question Draw (on paper, not in SPSS) a schematic graph of the interaction effect. Put relationship with coworkers on the X-axis, and emotional pressure on the Y-axis. Draw a schematic regression line for each group.</p>
<p>(Hint: first write out the two separate estimated models)</p>
<p>What is the (unstandardized) effect of relationship with coworkers on emotional pressure in the group of males?</p>
<p>The regression equation for the entire sample is:</p>
<p>LaTeX: ’ = scemoti ′ = LaTeX: b_0 + b_1<em> + b_2</em> + b_3* � 0 + � 1 ∗ Gender + � 2 ∗ sccowork + � 3 ∗ GenderTRelco</p>
<p>For males, the value of Gender is 0. That means that GenderTRelco is also 0. The regression equation for males then becomes:</p>
<p>LaTeX: _{male}’ = b_0 + b_2* scemoti � � � � ′ = � 0 + � 2 ∗ sccowork</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a new dummy variables: D1, (on which males score 1, and females 0)</li>
<li>Compute a new product variable (D1TRelCo = D1 * sccowork)</li>

<p>Perform a new regression analysis with D1, D1TRelCo and sccowork as predictors. This is exactly the same analysis, but now with women as reference group instead of men.</p>
<p>Look at the table with the estimated coefficients. What is the p-value of the effect of sccowork on scemoti within the female group?</p>
