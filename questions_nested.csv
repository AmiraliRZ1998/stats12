"Given two nested models, one has regression sum of squares = 283.96 and residual sum of squares = 958.58; the other has regression sum of squares = 202.76 and residual sum of squares = 1039.78. What is the delta R-squared between these models?", ".065", ".078", ".085", "Can't say with this information", "The delta R-squared is the difference in regression sums of squares, divided by the total sum of squares.

"In a nested model test, one model has regression sum of squares = 202.76 and 3 parameters and residual sum of squares = 1039.78, the other model has regression sum of squares = 283.96 and 4 parameters and residual sum of squares = 958.58. There are 387 participants. What is the F-value for the nested model test?", "32.44", "28.29", "24.90", "Can't say based on this information.", "The F-value is obtained by first calculating the regression mean square: dividing the difference in regression sum of squares by the difference in model DF: (283.957-202.758)/1, and calculating the residual mean square for the larger model: 958.58/(387-4). The F-value is then ((283.957-202.758)/1)/(958.58/(387-4))."
